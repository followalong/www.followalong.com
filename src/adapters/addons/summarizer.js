Military officials determined bringing it down over land from an altitude of 60,000 feet would pose an undue risk to people on the ground.\n\nThe balloon was spotted Saturday morning over the Carolinas as it approached the Atlantic coast. At about 2:40 p.m. EST, an F-22 fighter jet fired a missile at the balloon, puncturing it while it was about 6 nautical miles off the coast near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, senior defense officials said.\n\nThe debris landed in 47 feet of water, shallower than they had expected. Still, it was not immediately clear how long the recovery would take. The Navy is taking the lead, supported by the Coast Guard.\n\n“They successfully took it down and I want to compliment our aviators who did it,” Biden said after getting off Air Force One en route to Camp David.\n\nThe spectacle had Americans looking to the skies all week, wondering whether the mysterious balloon had floated over toward them.\n\nOn Saturday, Ashlyn Preaux, 33, went out to get her mail in Forestbrook, South Carolina, and noticed her neighbors looking up — and there it was, the balloon in the cloudless blue sky. Then she saw fighter jets circling and the balloon get hit.\n\n“I did not anticipate waking up to be in a ‘Top Gun’ movie today,” she said.\n\nU.S. defense and military officials said Saturday the balloon entered the U.S. air defense zone north of the Aleutian Islands on Jan. 28 and moved largely over land across Alaska and then into Canadian airspace in the Northwest Territories on Monday. It crossed back into U.S. territory over northern Idaho on Tuesday, the day the White House said Biden was first briefed on it.\n\nThe balloon was spotted Thursday over Montana, home to one of America’s three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base.\n\nThe Americans were able to collect intelligence on the balloon as it flew over the U.S., giving them a number of days to analyze it and learn how it moved and what it was capable of surveilling, a senior defense official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the ongoing operation and spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nChina has continued to claim the balloon was merely a weather research “airship” that had been blown off course. The Pentagon rejected that out of hand — as well as China’s contention it was not being used for surveillance and had only limited navigational ability.\n\nThe public disclosure of the balloon on Thursday prompted the cancellation of a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Beijing for talks aimed at reducing U.S.-China tensions.

"They successfully took it down and I want to compliment our aviators who did it. And we’ll have more to report on this a little later."\n\nThe Chinese balloon is shot down off the Carolina coast\nThe Chinese surveillance balloon was shot down off the Carolina coast on Feb. 4.@RealUSC via Twitter\nThe balloon was shot down at 2:39 p.m. by an F-22 raptor with a single missile, according to a senior defense official. The balloon was between 60,000 to 65,000 feet in the air when it was downed.\n\nThe debris field from the balloon extends across about 7 nautical miles, and ships and navy divers are expected to help recover the pieces, a senior U.S. military official told NBC News.\n\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the balloon was shot down "above U.S. territorial waters" off the coast of South Carolina.\n\n"This afternoon, at the direction of President Biden, U.S. fighter aircraft assigned to U.S. Northern Command successfully brought down the high altitude surveillance balloon launched by and belonging to the People’s Republic of China (PRC)," Austin said in the statement.\n\n"The balloon, which was being used by the PRC in an attempt to surveil strategic sites in the continental United States, was brought down above U.S. territorial waters," he said.\n\nBiden on Wednesday "gave his authorization to take down the balloon as soon as the mission could be accomplished without undue risk to American lives under the balloon’s path," he added. "After careful analysis, U.S. military commanders had determined downing the balloon while over land posed an undue risk to people across a wide area due to the size and altitude of the balloon and its surveillance payload."\n\nThe balloon entered U.S. airspace on Jan. 28 north of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska before entering Canadian airspace on Monday, the senior defense official said. It re-entered U.S. airspace on Tuesday in northern Idaho.\n\nOfficials have been analyzing the balloon over recent days, a senior defense official said, noting that it "was clearly crossing over sensitive sites, including sensitive military sites."\n\n“We have learned technical things about this balloon and its surveillance capabilities and I suspect if we are successful in recovering aspects of the debris we will learn even more,” the defense official said.\n\nHours before it was shot down, residents in North Carolina and South Carolina reported seeing the spy balloon, and the Federal Aviation Administration said it had paused departures and arrivals at three local airports to support the Defense Department in “a national security effort."\n\nFlights to and from the three airports — Wilmington International Airport and Myrtle Beach International Airport in North Carolina, and Charleston International Airport in South Carolina — have resumed, the FAA said Saturday afternoon in an update.\n\nAn airplane flies below a large balloon as it drifts above the Kingstown, N.C.\nAn airplane flies below a large balloon as it drifts above the Kingstown, N.C. area on Feb. 4.Brian Branch via AP\nVideos showing fighter jets targeting the spy balloon and taking it down are circulating on social media.

Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee tweeted, "The admin should have taken care of this before it became a national security threat. I hope we will be able to recover the wreckage to help determine what intelligence the CCP collected while its spy balloon was over our country for days. I will be demanding answers and will hold the admin accountable for this embarrassing display of weakness."\n\nNow that the balloon has been shot down, the Biden administration should make clear to China the gravity of its violation of U.S. airspace, a former Obama administration official said.\n\nBrett Bruen, who was director of global engagement in Barack Obama’s White House, said in an interview Saturday that Chinese President Xi Jinping “is probing and testing how far he can push the West and, in particular, Biden, and we have to respond in a strong and sustained way.”\n\nBruen suggested the U.S. consider recalling its ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, to protest China’s actions.',

//   'The U.S. economy added 517,000 jobs in January, blowing economists’ estimates out of the water and pushing the unemployment rate to a 53-year low of 3.4%.\n\nDespite rising interest rates, high inflation, and consistent announcements of tech sector layoffs, the labor market as a whole has remained incredibly resilient—and Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup, the third largest staffing firm in the world, thinks she knows why.\n\n“Pandemic paranoia has set in with employers who remember how hard it was to bring back workers,” she told Fortune. “So it makes sense that despite what we are seeing in headlines regarding layoffs, they are still well below historical norms—with fewer than 1% of the population laid off in December 2022 and an unemployment rate of 1.8% in tech.”\n\nAfter millions of workers lost their jobs during the initial stages of the pandemic in early 2020, stimulus checks and the rise of remote work helped spur consumer demand more than many economists had initially anticipated.\n\nThat left employers scrambling to rehire lost talent throughout the pandemic, but it was easier said than done. Worker shortages persisted across the economy because of a growing “skills gap” and quit rates that soared in a phenomenon now known as “The Great Resignation.”\n\nBy October of 2021, 73% of CEOs said that a labor and skills shortage was their company’s biggest challenge, Fortune found in a survey done in collaboration with Deloitte. And in some sectors, labor shortages continue even now—the metal fabrication industry, for example, expects a 400,000-worker shortage by next year. This lack of talent has helped keep the labor market running “like a bullet train,” Frankiewicz said.\n\n“From ManpowerGroup’s real-time data, we know that employers are actively adding to their workforces, particularly for permanent in-demand skills like registered nurses, software developers, retail workers, and hospitality workers,” she said, adding that many companies are also looking to entice “boomerang workers who made sector switches during the pandemic to come back.”\n\nFrankiewicz also argued that historically low labor force participation (62.4%)—which measures the percentage of the population that is working or actively looking for work—has exacerbated the worker shortage in the U.S., helping lower the unemployment rate.\n\n“We still have a participation problem in our country,” she said. “We are still in a jobs market where labor demand far outpaces supply, with 3 million fewer workers than before the pandemic.”\n\nAnd while the latest layoffs in the tech sector, which included over 70,000 lost jobs in the past year, have spooked some investors and captured headlines, Frankiewicz believes that they “are simply pandemic hiring coming full circle.”\n\nDuring the pandemic, tech firms went on a hiring spree like never before. Between 2019 and 2022, Google’s parent company Alphabet, for example, increased its headcount by 64%, while Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta both more than doubled theirs.\n\nJulia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, used the analogy of a war to explain the tech industries’ latest hiring patterns.\n\n“The pandemic was tech companies’ war—they were right on the front lines. Everyone was stuck at home on a computer, and they suddenly saw this surge in demand for what they were offering. So they pulled up the reservists; they surged manpower,” she told Fortune. “Now that moment’s over and things are calming down, so they are just getting back to normal with these layoffs…It’s the natural response to demand rising and demand falling.”\n\nAs far as where the labor market goes from here, Pollak said that conflicting data makes it difficult to tell, but she sees two potential outcomes.\n\n“Year-to-date hiring plans are pretty dismal right now. So it’s possible that companies are very worried about recession and they’re going to be more conservative when it comes to hiring,” she said. “On the other hand, it’s possible that employer demand for workers is still very high, and that the main constraint is supply. The widening gap between job openings and hires could reflect that companies just can’t hire enough right now, because so many people left the labor market.”\n\nAs former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers put it in a Bloomberg interview on Friday:\n\n“It’s a pretty confused picture…I think it’s as difficult an economy to read as I can remember.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Jan. 30, 2023, that he intends to end both the national emergency and the public health emergency declarations related to COVID-19 on May 11, 2023.\n\nBiden’s announcement came on the same day that the World Health Organization said it still considers the COVID-19 pandemic to be a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, a status that is reassessed every three months. The WHO’s advisory committee noted that although the pandemic is at a turning point, “COVID-19 remains a dangerous infectious disease with the capacity to cause substantial damage to health and health systems.”\n\nThe Conversation asked public health experts Marian Moser Jones and Amy Lauren Fairchild to put these statements into context and to explain their ramifications for the next stage of the pandemic.\n\nWhat does ending the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic mean?\nEnding the federal emergency reflects both a scientific and political judgment that the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis has ended and that special federal resources are no longer needed to prevent disease transmission across borders.\n\nIn practical terms, it means that two declarations – the federal Public Health Emergency, first declared on Jan. 31, 2020, and the COVID-19 national emergency that President Donald Trump announced on March 13, 2020 – will be allowed to expire in May 2023.\n\nDeclaring those emergencies enabled the federal government to cut through a mountain of red tape, with the goal of responding to the pandemic more efficiently. For instance, the declarations allowed funds to be made available so that federal agencies could direct personnel, equipment, supplies and services to state and local governments wherever they were needed. In addition, the declarations made resources available to launch investigations into the “cause, treatment or prevention” of COVID-19 and to enter into contracts with other organizations to meet needs stemming from the emergency.\n\nThe emergency status also allowed the federal government to make health care more widely available by suspending many requirements for accessing Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Program. And they made it possible for people to receive free COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccines and enabled Medicaid and Medicare to more easily cover telehealth services.\n\nWhat policy changes will occur once the emergency is declared over?\nThe end to the federal emergency could substantially reduce the number of people insured under Medicaid. Before the pandemic, states required people to prove every year that they met income and other eligibility requirements.\n\nIn March 2020, Congress enacted a continuous enrollment provision in Medicaid that prevented states from removing anyone from their rolls during the pandemic. In a December 2022 appropriations bill, Congress passed a provision that will end continuous enrollment on March 31, 2023.\n\nThe Biden administration has defended this time frame as sufficient to ensure that “patients do not lose access to care unpredictably” and that state Medicaid budgets – which have been infused with emergency funds since 2020 – “don’t face a radical cliff.” But many people with Medicaid may be unaware of these changes until they actually lose their benefits.\n\nSome states have already indicated that they will begin disenrolling members in April 2023 or require members to apply to be considered for renewal. This could result in between 5 million and 14 million people losing coverage.\n\nPeople with Medicare do not have to worry about losing their benefits, since this program is age-based, not income-based. The array of telehealth services that Medicare began covering during the pandemic will continue to be covered through December 2023. Medicare coverage for many telehealth services could also be made permanent after this year.\n\nThe end of the emergency could additionally curb access to COVID-19 drugs, tests and vaccines. Federal emergency funding for free treatment or vaccination will end when the emergency status is lifted on May 11. If such programs are to continue, the cost will fall to state and local health agencies or insurance companies.\n\nWe are concerned that the withdrawal of federal emergency funds for vaccination may further slow the already sluggish uptake of boosters. As of Jan. 25, 2023, about 20% of the population ages 5 and up and only 40.1% of those 65 and older – who are at the highest risk of death from COVID-19 – had received an updated bivalent booster dose. Once the emergency ends, measures that allowed a broad array of health providers – from pharmacist interns to retired nurses and even veterinarians – to administer vaccines will expire, which could lead to decreased access to vaccination in many parts of the U.S.\n\nWhat does this mean for the status of the pandemic?\nA pandemic declaration represents an assessment that human transmission of a disease, whether well known or novel, is “extraordinary,” that it constitutes a public health risk to two or more states and that controlling it requires an international response.\n\nAt some point the WHO will end its pandemic declaration. On Jan. 30, 2023, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the pandemic as being “at a transition point.” But the WHO’s assessment is that the risks are still considerable. Ghebreyesus noted that COVID-19 continues to strain health care systems, exacerbate health care workforce shortages and exceed surveillance system capacities.\n\nThe U.S. remains one of the global COVID-19 hot spots. With more than 3,500 hospitalizations per week on average in January 2023, and 3,452 deaths per week as of early February 2023, the U.S. has among the highest deaths per capita in the world.\n\nHow does the Biden administration’s stance differ from the WHO’s position?\nIn some ways they are very similar. The WHO is looking at the pandemic from a global perspective while the Biden administration is examining it from a national perspective. The WHO’s stance reflects the assessment that the world is not sufficiently vaccinated, that health care systems remain vulnerable and that unchecked disease transmission in some parts of the world should remain a source of international concern and attention.\n\nChina’s massive outbreak after the lifting of its zero-COVID policy in early December 2022 has received a great deal of media attention. But less noted is the fact that vaccination rates across African nations average 40%, and that vaccination rates are very low in countries that are experiencing conflict, such as Syria, where only 15% of the population has received any COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe WHO’s continuation of the global pandemic status signals that there is more international coordination and work to be done. In contrast, the Biden administration is making a social and political judgment that it is time to wind down the federal role.\n\nBiden’s order will not affect state-level or local-level emergency declarations. These declarations have allowed states to allocate resources to meet pandemic needs and have included provisions allowing them to respond to surges in COVID-19 cases by allowing out-of-state physicians and other health care providers to practice in person and through telehealth.\n\nAlmost all U.S. states, however, have ended their own public health emergency declarations. Eight states – California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, New Mexico, Rhode Island and Texas – still have emergency declarations in effect, but all of them will expire by the end of February 2023 unless renewed.\n\nWhile some states may choose to make permanent some COVID-era emergency standards, such as looser restrictions on telemedicine or out-of-state health providers, it could be a long time before either politicians or the public regain an appetite for any emergency orders directly related to COVID-19.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, an independent nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

The contractors work for a third-party company called Cognizant, and they are calling for the firm and YouTube-parent Google to revise the in-office policies to be more flexible.\n\nThe strike was first reported by Axios, which said the contractors voted to strike after receiving orders to report to an office in Austin starting on Monday. Google declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the Alphabet Workers Union, roughly a quarter of the striking workers are based outside of Texas, and a majority of the contractors had been initially hired as remote workers.\n\n“On average, YouTube music workers are paid $19 an hour and cannot afford the relocation, travel or childcare costs associated with in-person work,” the group said on its Facebook page. “The upcoming return to office date threatens the livelihoods of workers who do not live in the Austin area.”\n\nWith a global labor shortage and a stubbornly high number of job openings, forcing people back into the office could backfire. Leaders who require workers to be on site for more days than staffers prefer — and who threaten them with pay cuts or termination if they don’t comply — may be creating a longer-term problem, workplace experts say.\n\nMany leaders’ arguments for coming in to work are now focused on the need to preserve company culture, collaboration and mentoring of younger workers.\n\nFace time is important, but workplace research shows that neither culture nor collaboration are necessarily optimized just by having employees spend 40 hours a week in the same building. It also shows that when employees and teams are allowed to schedule their in-person versus remote time, it can boost engagement, morale and retention.',
//   'Inconsistency with high school exams a problem, say students and educators\nThough classrooms have largely returned to pre-pandemic operations, final exams aren\'t necessarily back on every high schooler\'s schedule.\n\nView original\nThough classrooms have largely returned to pre-pandemic operations, final exams aren\'t necessarily back on every high schooler\'s schedule. Over the past three years, students have faced different final assessments depending on their province, school board or even their individual teachers.\n\nWhile some reinstated exams as before, others have yet to resume the practice. \n\nThat inconsistency in approach is a concern, according to students, high school teachers and post-secondary educators who spoke with CBC News. \n\nMakayla McIntosh (Brampton, Ont.)\nA teen with long braided hair and wearing a grey sweat shirt sits in a bright and spacious kitchen, with an open laptop computer before her. A family room is behind.\n\nBrampton, Ont., student Makayla McIntosh just successfully completed her first exams ever in her Grade 9 classes, scoring marks in the 80s and 90s. \'You don\'t want your first exam to be in Grade 11 or 12 or in university, when that stuff really counts,\' she said. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\nDespite being a keen student who thoroughly prepared, Grade 9 student Makayla McIntosh was quite nervous and "dreading" her first-ever high school final exams this week.\n\n"The word \'exam\' — if they just called it a test, I think it\'d be a lot less [stressful]," she said. The Dufferin Peel Catholic School Board student had just finished exams in geography, science, business technology and physical education. \n\nDespite her earlier anxiety, the 14-year-old was nonetheless happy she had exams in the first place. She thinks they\'re valuable for younger high schoolers. \n\n"You don\'t want your first exam to be in Grade 11 or 12 or in university, when that stuff really counts," said McIntosh, who hopes to make the honour roll. "I think it\'s good to get practice in."\n\nThe teen found that it felt like "just a test and it\'s not that bad," she added. "I was surprised, to be honest … I think we stressed ourselves out for no reason."\n\nJules Pryma (Abbotsford, B.C.)\nA man in a grey-and-yellow patterned shirt stands in a school office room. Flyers affixed to the wall and neat piles of papers are seen stacked on shelves behind him.\n\nAbbotsford, B.C., teacher Jules Pryma, who has taught high school science for 25 years, believes exams are absolutely necessary for Grade 11 and 12 students. (Submitted by Jules Pryma)\nHigh school teacher Jules Pryma, on the other hand, has a different perspective. Having developed and adapted his approach to assessments over 25 years of teaching science, he thinks Grades 9 and 10 might be a bit young for high-stakes final exams. Yet he considers them imperative for senior students\n\nThe Abbotsford School District educator counts final exams as a valuable tool, alongside a host of others, such as in-class discussions, small- and larger-group work assignments or demonstrating knowledge of more practical skills (such as handling glassware in chemistry) during unit tests.\n\nLower diploma exam weighting brings student relief, but could affect motivation, teachers say\nN.L. cancels public exams for current school year, expands review for future years\nPryma believes that current inconsistency in grading and testing at the secondary level contributes to a trend of inflated marks and students unprepared for post-secondary education, whether their choice is university, college or trades programs.\n\n"They cross the country to go to a school and they\'re [expecting] to be prepared for the rigours of this," he said. "And certainly in science and in mathematics … in those areas those students need to be well prepared — and we\'re not preparing them well enough."\n\nWhile he doesn\'t advocate simply returning to the practices of the past — "we can come up with way better exams," he said — Pryma considers exams a necessity. \n\n"The focus has to be on knowledge and skills, and not just predominantly on skills," he said. "And [it] has to be done as an individual, in some spot where they are working independently, on their own."\n\nIshaal Ali (Ottawa)\nA teen girl with long curly hair and glasses stands outdoors. A large snowbank is seen behind her.\n\nThough having her first-ever exams cancelled by her Ottawa school board initially felt \'like almost a weight being lifted off my shoulders,\' Grade 10 student Ishaal Ali now feels that she\'s at a disadvantage. (Submitted by Ishaal Ali)\nWhen she started Grade 10 this year, Ishaal Ali throught the fall semester would end with her first-ever series of final exams because "we were getting back on track after COVID."\n\nHowever, when she learned several weeks ago that her board — the Ottawa Carleton District School Board — cancelled finals for Grade 9 and 10 students, the 15-year-old had mixed feelings. \n\nInitially, "it was like almost a weight being lifted off my shoulders," said Ali. However, that soon gave way to new stress about writing exams without any experience in her Grade 11 year, when grades begin to count for post-secondary studies.\n\nJanuary \'break\' for some OCDSB students gets failing grade from parents\nAli\'s teachers ultimately offered different summative assessments, including some written tests, along with an in-class debate in French, and an essay and visual presentation for her history class. She appreciated their approaches, but says she doesn\'t feel as ready for the future as students who have experience writing exams.\n\n"It also sort of gives them an advantage for Grade 11, which I think can create fluctuations between … the school boards, like in terms of grades and percentages and marks," she said. \n\nAli doesn\'t think final exams are always the best or only way to measure student learning, but she does want to see consistency. "If there is such a standard [for having final exams]… then everybody should be doing them."\n\nTasha Ausman (Gatineau, Que.)\nA woman with short hair smiles at the camera in this black and white portrait.\n\nTasha Ausman teaches high school math and science teacher in Gatineau, Que., says final exams should be one component of a variety of assessments given to students. (Van Tran Photography)\nQuizzes, tests and exams show how students fare "under time-bound, high-stress examination contexts," but solely relying on those simply rewards the students that perform well under those particular circumstances, says Tasha Ausman, a high school math and science teacher in the Western Quebec School Board and a part-time curriculum studies professor at the University of Ottawa. \n\nShe described a lively conversation happening among the teacher, pre-service teacher and education researcher communities today that\'s exploring the complexity of assessment and how to ensure the methods being used offer "a really robust picture of what students know and what they can do, through a variety of assessments, whereby something like a final exam is only one piece of that puzzle."\n\nWATCH | As exams return for some students, so does the debate on their value for evaluating learning:\n\n\n\nHigh schools face exam anxiety after years of pandemic learning\nSome high school students are anxiously preparing to write exams for the first time ever, since many schools paused the tests during the height of the pandemic. It\'s reigniting a debate among educators over whether exams are truly the best way to grade students.\nAs provincial ministries and departments of education work on updating K-12 assessment to consider a "complete picture of the learner," she said, and though there does tend to be more formative, project-based and non-testing kinds of assessments eventually for post-secondary students, change takes time. \n\nMost students today will face exams, Ausman noted, whether it be standardized tests, admission assessments for a particular program of study or different high-stakes tests that come after high school — whether they\'re choosing to study a trade, enrol in college or in university.\n\n"The entire system is not instantaneously rewriting itself," she said. \n\nLouis Volante (St. Catharines, Ont.)\nA man in glasses, a white button down shirt and black sweater stands in his office, with shelves filled with books and a window seen behind him.\n\n\'The fact of the matter is that high school students need to be prepared to write and sit exams,\' because so many will be pursuing post-secondary studies, where they\'ll inevitably be doing them, says Brock University education professor Louis Volante. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\nWhat\'s needed is better alignment between what happens at the senior high school level and with first and second-year college and university students, "because those tend to be the most difficult years when it comes to things like testing anxiety," according to educational researcher and Brock University professor Louis Volante. \n\n"It would be in the senior grades — 11 and 12 — when those grades count toward admission and the first and second-year students, who are at an increased risk for academic failure," he said.\n\nPandemic learning left students feeling behind. Post-secondary transition courses aim to get them on track\nThere must be more consistency and updates to provincial assessment frameworks governing how senior high schoolers students are evaluated "so that there\'s a common metric and there\'s a common structure that they experience," said Volante, a professor of educational studies at the St. Catharines, Ont., school and president of the Canadian Society for the Study of Education. \n\nWithout these, he added, the situation will continue to be a double-edged sword: both for students who are ill-prepared and struggle once attending post-secondary as well as for those who aren\'t accepted in the first place because more rigorous assessment left them with lower marks.\n\n"The fact of the matter is that high school students need to be prepared to write and sit exams and to have those kinds of skills because they\'re inevitably going to be … writing a lot of traditional paper and pencil tests [in post-secondary]," he said.',
//   'A GTA man took just an hour to find his dad\'s stolen car. But police say it wasn\'t a great idea\nRather than leave the case to police, Rami Temani took matters into his own hands last November and tracked down his father\'s car after it was stolen from a mall parking lot in Oakville, Ont.\n\nView original\nWhen the 2021 Nissan Rogue that belongs to his father was stolen in Oakville, Ont., late last year, Rami Temani says he immediately called police.\n\nBut after being told it would take several hours for officers to arrive, and seeing the transactions rack up on his mother\'s debit card at nearby locations, Temani decided he had to take matters into his own hands.\n\nHe was at the Goodlife Fitness in the Oakville Place mall back in November, waiting to meet up with his mother at the gym. He says his mother left her car keys in a gym locker before returning to find them missing, along with her wallet. \n\n"I knew exactly what happened. I knew that the car was gone," Temani said.\n\nThe family\'s story is not unique. They\'re among the hundreds of people in Halton Region west of Toronto who have fallen victim to car theft —  a crime that is now rampant across the province. In 2022, roughly 1,380 vehicles were stolen across the region, according to Halton police data. In Toronto alone, more than 8,000 vehicles were reported stolen in 2022. That number is up from about 5,600 in 2021. \n\n\'Stop, don\'t go,\' dispatcher warned Temani\nHalton Regional Police say they were notified about the theft at roughly 9:55 p.m.\n\nAlmost immediately after the car was stolen, Temani says his mother was notified of charges on her credit card for more than $800 from nearby gas stations and convenience stores. That\'s when he began to drive to each one, hoping to find the vehicle, even though the 911 dispatcher warned him not to.\n\n"She was very rude," he told CBC Toronto, adding that the dispatcher "was just yelling at me, telling me to stop, don\'t go. So I hung up the phone."\n\nAfter roughly more than an hour of driving around the area, Temani says he spotted the car behind a Petro-Canada gas station near Upper Middle Road East and Eighth Line, just three kilometres from where it had been stolen. He notified police immediately.\n\nWhat auto thieves in Ontario want and how you can stop them\nA major increase in auto thefts in 2022 has victims and industry experts calling for action\nHis father, Khaled Temani, who owns a trucking company, says he thought his car, along with important work papers, would be long gone when he learned it had been stolen.\n\n"I was shocked ... I got everything in my car. My business, my briefcase, my paperwork, everything is inside," he said.\n\nHalton police located the stolen 2021 Nissan Rogue behind a Petro-Canada gas station in Oakville after Temani notified them. (Submitted by Rami Temani)\n"I never heard about somebody whose car was stolen and found it right away. So I was like thinking, \'That\'s it, man.

She was held for bail.\n\nBut if anyone\'s thinking of emulating Rami Temani\'s decision to track the vehicle down himself, police strongly advise against it.\n\n"We would always urge residents to contact police in situations like this as we would not wish for a resident to put themselves at risk," said Halton Police spokesperson Steve Elms.\n\n"You go up to these people that are stealing vehicles, you have no idea who you\'re going to be dealing with.

(Catarina Demony/Reuters)\n\nWhen his dog was born three decades ago in a tiny village in central Portugal, Leonel Costa was only eight years old. Little did he know that his beloved Bobi would one day be recorded as the world\'s oldest dog.\n\nWhen Bobi, a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo, celebrated his 30th birthday last year, Costa knew he had broken an almost century-old record held by an Australian cattle-dog that died at 29 years and five months in 1939.\n\nCosta got in touch with the Guinness World Records, submitted all the paperwork and a year later Bobi was officially named the oldest dog on record.\n\nBobi was 30 years and 269 days old as of Feb. 4.\n\n"It\'s a feeling of pride we can\'t explain," Costa, 38, told Reuters as he petted Bobi near a church in the village of Conqueiros in central Portugal.\n\n"Some people told us we wouldn\'t make it ... but we knew Bobi\'s age and were sure the exams would only prove what we already knew."\n\nThe Guinness World of Records, which made the announcement on Thursday, described Bobi\'s story as "miraculous."\n\nPuppy found hidden in a pile of wood\nAt the time Bobi was born, Costa\'s family had many animals and little money, so his father, a hunter, generally buried newborn puppies rather than keep them. But Bobi hid in a pile of firewood. Costa and his siblings found the pup a few days later and kept him a secret until the puppy opened his eyes.\n\n"We knew that when he opened his eyes, my parents wouldn\'t be able to bury him, " he said.\n\nBobi\'s breed usually has a life expectancy of 12 to 14 years, and Costa attributed the dog\'s longevity to a number of factors, including living in calm countryside, never having been chained or kept on a leash and always eating "human food."\n\nLove and affection helped with longevity\n"Of course our love and affection throughout his life has also helped," he said, giggling.\n\nAlthough Bobi still loves walks, age is taking its toll: The dog is less adventurous, his fur is thinning, his eyesight has worsened and he needs to rest more than he used to.\n\nCosta hopes Bobi has many more years of life and is thankful the dog has put the remote village of Conqueiros on the map.\n\n"There were other animals here who lived long lives, but Bobi surpassed everything."',

//   'Italy\'s far-right threat has vanished, but a familiar dread returns as Meloni settles into office\nAs she reached the first 100 days of her mandate this past week, there\'s a familiar dread that Giorgia Meloni is steering Italy on a slow, steady decline.\n\nView original\nAfter Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni won the national election last September, many expressed alarm that the leader of the once outlier Brothers of Italy, a party with neo-fascist origins, would wrench the country sharply to the right.\n\nAs she reached the first 100 days of her mandate this past week, though, those fears have all but evaporated, replaced instead by a familiar dread that the 46-year-old first-time prime minister is steering Italy along the exact same course as almost all other leaders have in the past three decades: a slow, steady decline.\n\nThe country suffers from low productivity and meagre salaries; is tied up in cumbersome red tape and under-invested in research; has no real immigration plan and is ever increasingly drained of its most promising young people, with 1.2 million young Italians now working abroad for better opportunities.\n\n"What Italy needs now are ideas," said Nathalie Tocci, an Italian political scientist and director of Istituto Affari Internazionali, the Rome-based International Affairs Institute. "And there aren\'t any."\n\nLow expectations for Meloni\nMeloni was elected after a brief technical government led by the well-respected former EU banker Mario Draghi. Many Italians had pinned their hopes on him to turn the country around.\n\nCompared to expectations of Meloni so low they bordered on catastrophic, Tocci said, she has performed well as prime minister so far.\n\nDuring last fall\'s election campaign, Meloni delivered fiery denunciations against political correctness and "LGBT lobbies," expressed zero tolerance for migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea and mocked the European Union, whom she\'d long dismissed as useless, for fearing her.\n\nYet already in the early hours of the morning following her election victory, a toned-down Meloni took the stage: sombre, serious, looking more spooked than celebratory.\n\nNewly elected Italian leader Giorgia Meloni speaks into a microphone.\n\nMeloni speaks to the media at her party\'s electoral headquarters in Rome on Sept. 25, 2022.

It\'s also magnificent she\'s keeping detestable people like Salvini and [Silvio] Berlusconi in their place."\n\nThe sentiment has begun to be reflected in the polls.\n\nRising popularity\nMeloni\'s popularity has shot to above 30 per cent from the 26 per cent she and her party garnered in fall elections, albeit with an historically low turnout. Support for Salvini and Berlusconi, on the other hand, has withered.\n\nMeloni can call the shots among her allies and faces virtually no opposition.\n\n"Things have been good for her so far," said Tocci. "But the million-dollar question is, what will happen when they\'re not."\n\nIn the meantime, observers say, without a radical movement toward modernization, the country is destined to further decline.\n\nThe elephant in every decision-making room is a debt approaching 150 per cent of its GDP — the third most burdensome of developed nations, just behind Greece and Japan.

But the funds come with strict dictates on how it can be spent – from digitalization and innovation to renewable energy and travel infrastructure — with Meloni already complaining the money is not enough.\n\nYet what\'s really missing, say observers, is a political class with enough competence, vision and guts to carry out the reforms the country needs to grow and keep future generations from leaving.\n\n"Meloni is probably much more intelligent than most Italian politicians," said Sottilotta.

//   'Rural ER docs are struggling to do it all. Peer support programs try to lessen the load\nRural emergency care can be challenging, with fewer staff, limited resources and complex health needs.\n\nView original\nWhen a woman in labour came to the emergency centre in a remote B.C. community, Dr. Mary Koziol needed help.\n\nShe was early in her career and doesn\'t specialize in obstetrics, so Koziol called a peer support line to speak with an on-call maternity specialist. The peer physician walked her through all the different scenarios and stayed on the video call during the birth to provide guidance.\n\n"It could have left me feeling bad about myself as a doctor, or like I shouldn\'t be providing care in rural communities. Instead, it was a really empowering experience and reminded me that even though I\'m not going to have all the skills and experiences that a rural community sometimes demands of you, that I can get that from elsewhere," Koziol said.\n\nPeer-to-peer support lines in B.C. and Ontario are vital for rural emergency physicians, doctors say. \n\nA woman is seen wearing a mask in a doctor\'s office. \n\nDr. Mary Koziol, an emergency physician, used B.C.\'s support line several times earlier in her career. She says it helped her in a lot of situations. (Submitted by Mary Koziol)\nThey say with many remote or rural communities facing staffing shortages that, in some cases, are leading to temporary emergency department closures, knowing that peer support is available can help retain doctors.\n\n"I think these kinds of programs are critical," said Dr. Daniel Howes, a professor of emergency medicine and critical care at Queen\'s University.\n\nLeaders call for more government action to keep rural ERs open 24 hours/day across the province\nEmergency rooms in rural B.C. were closed for equivalent of around 4 months in 2022, data shows\nIn B.C., the support program is taking it one step further, with doctors filling overnight vacancies in emergency departments that would otherwise close for a few hours.\n\n"If a group like ours can just come in and do the weekends, that does a lot for doctors actually wanting to stay in that community. I think it also does a lot for recruitment," said Dr. Brydon Blacklaws, an emergency physician in Powell River, B.C., and co-lead of the Real-Time Virtual Support (RTVS) program. \n\nHow it works\nIn her 20 years as an emergency physician, Dr. Kylie Booth says no shift goes by without her talking to a peer about a patient. \n\nShe says brainstorming with peers "is absolutely indispensable to your confidence, to your interest in coming back another day to do what is a very difficult job." \n\nSo when the COVID-19 pandemic sparked wider use of video calls, Booth seized the opportunity to start a peer-to-peer support line for emergency department physicians working in rural settings in Ontario.\n\nShe knows the need is high, as many rural doctors are doing it all, with fewer resources at their disposal. \n\n"Not only might they be the only doctor in the emergency department, they are likely the only doctor in the hospital proper. So they are wearing lots of hats," she added.\n\nWith the Ontario peer-to-peer support program, doctors in 27 remote hospitals are able to call and get the thoughts of a colleague who isn\'t attending to their own patients or running their own ER, Booth said. They\'re only taking calls from the support line.\n\nSITUATION CRITICAL\n\nRural emergency rooms are bearing the brunt of health-care shortages, B.C. doctors warn\nNorthwestern Ontario hospital ERs continue to undergo strain amid staff shortages, burnout\n"We have one physician on for 12 hours and the breadth of cases has been quite remarkable," she said.\n\nShe says there have been calls about severe cases, but many of the phone calls have been for help with patient management when resources are limited. \n\n"These physicians that are working in rural or remote sites are the best of the best," Booth said. \n\n"What they\'re calling for is that second set of eyes on a case, a second set of hands at the bedside to allow them to make the next best choice for the patient to bring that high-quality care right to the patient\'s bedside."\n\nIt\'s still early days for Ontario\'s peer-to-peer physician support program. The pilot launched in October and currently has funding until the end of March. Booth hopes funding continues. \n\nShe says iterations of a peer-to-peer support program have tried to launch in Ontario before. \n\nIn this screenshot from a promotional video of a mock-up, volunteer peer Dr. Chris Parker tests the setup that would be used in an early pilot of a peer-to-peer support line for rural doctors a decade ago. (Submitted by Daniel Howes/ Queen\'s University)\nHowes knows that all too well. He and his colleagues launched a pilot peer-to-peer support program about a decade ago. \n\nThey wired security cameras — similar to those found in casinos at the time — in five emergency rooms to connect with rural doctors around Kingston, Ont. The pilot ended after six months when funding dried up and physicians volunteering their time struggled to take on shifts, Howes said. \n\nBut there\'s still a need to help rural physicians, he said.\n\n"These kinds of programs are going to be essential if we\'re going to continue with the same sort of model of distributed emergency care in our country," he said.\n\n"The work that these folks do in these centres is often just as acute and the crises are just as significant."\n\nCan it help with retention?\nHandling those crises in rural settings with fewer resources does take its toll on the health-care providers working in these emergency centres. \n\nA 2021 survey by the Canadian Medical Association found that doctors who practice in small towns or in isolated and remote areas "are significantly more likely to be experiencing burnout than those in urban/suburban areas."\n\nDoctors and others have said that rural emergency rooms are bearing the brunt of the health care shortages. \n\nNo current plans to reopen overnight emergency services in Alberton, P.E.I.\n\'Grave danger\' of further shortages unless more done to attract, retain physicians: Doctors Manitoba\nThe B.C. support line, known as the Rural Urgent Doctors in-aid (RUDi) program, has seen that demand on health care providers in rural, remote or First Nations communities through the increase in the number of calls to the service. \n\nWhen the program first launched in 2020, Blacklaws says there were a handful of calls every few weeks. Now the doctor on-call gets on average 34 calls during a 12-hour shift. \n\nThe calls can range in severity, which means sometimes those calling the line will have to wait, he says. \n\n"We\'re not perfect by any stretch, but we are trying and we are improving," he added.\n\nSince its launch, the B.C. program has expanded to include phone numbers for on-call pediatrics and maternity and newborn specialists. Other specialists like those who specialize in dermatology or neurology are also available during the week on short notice.\n\nWATCH | Doctors Manitoba president says more to do to \'woo\' doctors to rural, northern communities:\n\n\n\n\nManitoba needs to do more to \'woo\' doctors to rural, northern communities\nDoctors Manitoba president Dr. Candace Bradshaw outlines ways the province could do more to support physicians already working in the system and attract more to choose Manitoba.\nKeeping doctors from burning out and leaving the community is a huge part of what the peer support programs in both provinces are striving for.\n\n"This program doesn\'t mint new practitioners. But if we can support the ones that are already in the field then that would be excellent to keep them coming back to emerg because there\'s certainly other ways to practice medicine. And if we lose those folks in emerg, that problem obviously gets exacerbated," Booth said. \n\nA man is seen in scrubs on a phone.\n\nDr. Ian Ricketson is one of the RUDi physicians who takes calls from peers across B.C. (Submitted by Rural Coordination Centre of BC )\nIn B.C., Blacklaws says the team also sometimes supports smaller medical centres with virtual backfill overnight as needed, so the doctor in the community has a chance to rest.\n\nAs a result, doctors through the program have also helped to prevent about 1,800 hours of diversion (when patients arriving by ambulance are sent to another hospital) since 2021. \n\nBlacklaws says there has been some criticism of the virtual backfill, as some have said it\'s best to have a doctor in-person. He emphasizes that the doctor in the community is called in when there\'s a severe case.\n\n"If we can give that doctor some rest, I think the patients in that community really do benefit because they\'re going to get a doctor that\'s less likely to burn out … and have more energy for their community and their practice in the morning," he said.\n\n\'At the breaking point\': Doctors call staff shortages in rural, northern Manitoba a crisis\nNorth Vancouver Island doctor says 2 resignations mean he\'ll be working solo in local ER\nHowes says these peer-to-peer support lines could benefit doctors in other parts of Canada, too. \n\n"It really benefits everybody. It\'s good for the patient because you get two heads instead of one and you get more resources, which is fantastic," he said.\n\nKoziol says knowing she can get a colleague\'s second opinion in a matter of minutes has convinced her to take shifts in smaller areas over the years.\n\n"Within my first few years of practice, I\'m not sure if I would have taken all of the rural locums that I had if I hadn\'t known that was available to me," she said.\n\n"It was really a bit of a security blanket."',
//   'How electric vehicles are sparking a battery recycling revolution\nA new generation of Canadian recyclers have sprung up to make sure used EV batteries — and the precious minerals inside — don’t go to waste.\n\nBy Krista Hessey\n\nUpdated Feb. 03, 2023 06:33 PMView original\nRecycling batteries seems like a no-brainer. But our track record has been lousy.\n\nHard numbers are difficult to come by, but in Canada, the U.S., and many European countries, it’s estimated that only two to 11 per cent of lithium-ion batteries find their way to a recycling facility when they die. Instead, they sit forgotten in cupboards or drawers or worse, end up in landfills.\n\nElectric cars could change that. Their batteries are too big, too toxic, and too valuable to simply throw away. The global EV revolution has given rise to a new recycling industry that hopes to capitalize on this future waste problem and help solve a looming minerals shortage.\n\n“I think of it as urban mining,” says Ajay Kochhar, co-founder and CEO of Li-Cycle, a Canadian battery recycler that wants to make sure the precious minerals in EV batteries don’t go to waste.\n\nA worker at Li-Cycle’s Kingston, ON facility uses a lift assist to move EV battery modules from a skid to the conveyor. Brent Rose / Global News\nLi-Cycle’s Kingston, Ont. facility doesn’t resemble a mine; there’s no hole in the ground or tailings. Instead, a handful of workers unpack skids of old or defective electric vehicle battery modules, carefully lifting them onto a conveyor belt. Then, one by one, they are dropped into a chemical solution before being shredded.\n\nThis stage of the recycling process breaks down the batteries into three distinct components: plastics, metals, and black mass. The latter is Li-Cycle’s bread and butter.\n\nBlack mass is a dark, shiny dirt-like substance that contains a concoction of minerals needed for new batteries. To retrieve them, the black mass must go through a complex process that involves using an acid solution to leach and separate the minerals. The end products are battery-grade materials ready to be sold back to battery manufacturers.\n\nThis new technology is being perfected by a cluster of Canadian battery recyclers, all vying for their slice of the global market. The first wave of end-of-life EV batteries is expected to come in 2030, when an estimated 1.7 million tonnes of battery waste will need to be disposed of.\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning.\n\nMore cars, more minerals\nToday, there are about 20 million passenger EVs on the road. While that’s a small fraction of the global fleet, there could be 10 times that amount by the end of the decade, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nCountries, including Canada, have set ambitious targets for all new car sales to be zero emission by the end of the next decade. That’s left car manufacturers scrambling to keep up with demand — faced with the daunting task of re-imagining their fleets and supply chains.\n\n“There really hasn’t been a change of this scale since we moved from the horse and buggy to the original combustion engine, which was a process that took over 100 years,” says Evan Pivnick, a program manager at Clean Energy Canada, a think tank focused on climate and the energy transition. “This time, we’re trying to get there in just a couple of decades.”\n\nPowering most electric vehicles are huge lithium-ion battery packs that can weigh more than 1,000 pounds. Battery chemistries vary slightly, but lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese are considered crucial for these new batteries.\n\nThese minerals are more than sufficient in the earth’s crust, but unevenly distributed, says Steven B. Young, an industrial ecologist and associate professor at the University of Waterloo.\n\nHuge pools of brine containing lithium carbonate and mounds of salt by-products stretch across a lithium mine in the Atacama Desert. Chile is the world’s second-largest producer of lithium after Australia. ucas Aguayo Araos/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\nA handful of nations produce the world’s critical mineral supply. Lithium is sourced from Australia and increasingly, Chile, Argentina and Bolivia — a region of South America now dubbed “the lithium triangle.” China produces graphite, while the Democratic Republic of the Congo provides cobalt.\n\nThe demand for minerals is expected to skyrocket over the next two decades. The IEA predicts nickel and cobalt demand will surge to more than 60 per cent, and lithium nearly 90 per cent.\n\nThe issue that will plague the EV movement in the years to come is the global mining industry’s inability to keep pace. In a scenario that meets the Paris Agreement goals, the IEA estimates that lithium and cobalt will be in short supply by 2030 — with today’s mines only able to provide about half of what’s needed for the overall energy transition.\n\n“A mine does take a long time to build in most countries,” Pivnick says. “So we’ve got this supply and demand crunch that’s being forecast.”\n\nThere’s a consensus that more mining is necessary to decarbonize global transport. But long-term, even if we could mine indefinitely, there’s the question of whether we should. Mineral extraction comes with heavy environmental and human costs.\n\nArtisanal miners carry sacks of ore containing cobalt at the Shabara artisanal mine near Kolwezi on October 12, 2022. Congo produced 72 percent of the world’s cobalt in 2021. JUNIOR KANNAH/AFP via Getty Images\n“There is a fundamental sort of tradeoff or contradiction,” Young says. “We need more of this stuff to make our modern lives more sustainable for everyone, but because it’s inequitably dispersed, the environmental impacts and the social impacts will also be inequitably distributed.”\n\nThat’s where recycling comes in. Part of the solution to this supply problem lies in what happens to EV batteries when they run out of juice.\n\nThe disruptors\nWhen Kochhar and his business partner Tim Johnston started Li-Cycle in 2016, people would ask them why they were even bothering to recover lithium.\n\n“Lo and behold, that’s proven to be important six years later,” Kochhar says. “Lithium is the most valuable component now of those batteries.”\n\nTraditionally, batteries have been recycled through smelting, a high-temperature melting-and-extraction process that can recover cobalt, nickel, and copper but not lithium, which gets burned off. It’s an energy-intensive method that can emit toxic fumes that are harmful to people and the environment.\n\nIn the 20 years since Sony released the first rechargeable lithium-ion battery, researchers and engineers have been developing greener, more efficient ways to recycle them through hydrometallurgy. Technological breakthroughs in this field weren’t enough, though, to kickstart the lithium-ion battery recycling industry in North America.\n\nAfter all, the batteries that power our devices are typically small and you’d need to recycle a whole lot of them to turn a profit. Instead, old or defective batteries are typically shipped off to China or South Korea, countries with established battery manufacturing and recycling markets.\n\nOld or defective electric car battery modules travel up the conveyor. Each will drop into a chemical solution before being shredded. Brent Rose / Global News\nElectric cars with their briefcase-sized battery modules will give this new generation of Canadian recyclers the stock they need to run commercial operations and be profitable. Li-Cycle is seen as a pioneer in lithium-ion battery recycling in this country, and is now expanding its reach across the U.S. and Europe with new 10,000-tonne-capacity plants in Alabama, Arizona, Norway, and Germany.\n\nRight now, Li-Cycle’s black mass is sold to outside vendors. But later this year, they will open a new plant in upstate New York where they’ll produce raw battery materials — like lithium carbonate, nickel sulphate, and cobalt sulfate — in-house. That plant, which it calls “the hub,” will become one of the first sources of recycled lithium in North America.\n\n“We’re getting up to 95 per cent recoverable material from those batteries,” Kochhar says.\n\nA drone view of the construction of Li-Cycle’s Rochester, NY facility. The plant will act as a regional hub where black mass will be processed into battery-grade materials. Courtesy: Li-Cycle\nLi-Cycle’s competitors here in Canada are not far behind.\n\nOn the west coast, RecycLiCo uses its five-stage patented process to recover 100 per cent of minerals in the black mass. At their pilot plant in Richmond, B.C., they are perfecting leaching the minerals from black mass at scale. CEO Zarko Meseldzija is banking on a future in which battery makers will bake in the recycling process at their new facilities.\n\n“The knowledge gap is actually what to do with the black mass,” Meseldzija says. “[Battery makers] can give it to a Li-Cycle … or what they could do is build it in-house.”\n\nAlso in B.C., Cirba Solutions operates a legacy battery recycling facility in Trail where it’s already taking in EV batteries. The company has five other facilities in the U.S. that do the first stage of recycling and has plans to add hydrometallurgical processing to their existing Ohio plant this year.\n\nInside barrels at Li-Cycle’s Kingston plant are retired consumer batteries wrapped in plastic. These batteries help to supplement battery supply while recyclers wait for more EV batteries to come off the road. Brent Rose / Global News\nDavid Klanecky, the CEO of Cirba Solutions, says he’s eyeing an expansion to Quebec since the province is leading Canada in electric vehicle sales, second only to B.C.\n\nGeneral Motors plans to build a battery manufacturing facility in Bécancour, Que., and that sweetens the deal.\n\n“We’re actively looking at areas in the Quebec region to expand our footprint there,” Klanecky says.\n\nThey’ll face stiff competition. Quebec-based Lithion Recycling is building its first full-scale commercial facility there, which is expected to be completed later this year. They’re licensing their patented mechanical shredding process to whoever wants it, giving auto recyclers the opportunity to get into the battery recycling business and establishing a network of local plants that will provide Lithion with black mass.\n\nThe company has already penned a deal with GM to supply them with recycled battery-grade materials for use in their new EV line.\n\n“OEMs [car manufacturers] understand the importance of battery recycling,” says Benoit Couture, the CEO of Lithion Recycling. “They looked at battery end-of-life and said, ‘Oh, that’s the way to hedge my supply.’”\n\nDrill, cellphone, and laptop batteries are dumped onto the conveyor at Li-Cycle’s Kingston, ON plant. Each battery must be unwrapped and checked to make sure it is lithium-ion. Brent Rose / Global News\nWhat’s behind the battery recycling boom\nCar manufacturers have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Canadian battery recyclers. They have a vested interest in having a robust, local recycling network at their fingertips where they can offload rejects while getting a consistent supply of lithium, cobalt and nickel.\n\nToday, most mineral refining and battery manufacturing happens in Asia, and particularly in China. But geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions due to COVID lockdowns there have sparked a massive push to bring battery-making home to North America.\n\nThe passing of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act adds even more momentum to this shift.\n\nTax credits have spurred plans to build a handful of gigafactories, giant facilities where they make EV batteries, in the United States in the coming years. Tesla and Volkswagen have also set their sights on Canada for their new regional gigafactories due to the country’s abundance of clean hydro energy.\n\nAerial view of Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory on October 20, 2022 in Shanghai, China. VCG/VCG via Getty Images\n“Hydropower is really important to make sure that we’re not just making electric vehicles that will cut greenhouse gases enormously, but that we build the batteries, and the EVs in the most sustainable way that we can,” says David Paterson, vice president of corporate and environmental affairs for GM Canada.\n\nThe goal is to create a regional ecosystem where the entire value chain — renewable-energy supply, raw material, battery manufacturing, recycling — comes together. That’s what people mean when they refer to developing a “circular economy” around electric vehicles. It promises to lower greenhouse gas emissions and the costs of the battery, something experts agree needs to happen to make EVs cheaper and accelerate adoption.\n\nThat circular dream has not yet materialized, but it has a lot of hype and money backing it. Both the U.S. and Canadian governments have made multi-billion-dollar investments in establishing this new auto sector in North America. Recycling is just one part of that vision, albeit an important one.\n\n“There’s so much unknown that’s left to be decided,” Pivnick says. Even still, he’s optimistic. Last year, Canada came in second in a global EV battery supply chain ranking, surpassing the U.S. and behind only China.\n\nBarrels and skids of batteries wait to be shredded and broken down at Li-Cycle’s Kingston facility. Kat Cheng / Global News\nChallenges ahead\nRecyclers are building the plane as they fly. Different vehicle manufacturers have adopted different battery types and configurations. Lithium-ion is the favourite chemistry right now, but innovations in battery technology abound. BMW recently announced it will build its own solid-state batteries, a new type of battery technology that proponents say is more efficient, safer, and produces fewer emissions than lithium-ion batteries.\n\nCollection and transportation of batteries is also logistically difficult and expensive. EV batteries are heavy and classified as hazardous goods since they retain a significant charge. The battery packs pose another challenge. They’re designed to be hard to dismantle, presumably for safety reasons, forcing recyclers to find workarounds like shredding entire packs without discharging and disassembling them.\n\nA worker scraps the black mass off plates into large white bags. It will be shipped off to a third party to be processed further. Kat Cheng / Global News\nThe biggest challenge Canadian recyclers say they face today is getting their hands on enough supply. For now, they’re surviving off battery manufacturing scrap, EV defects, and consumer batteries, like laptops, cell phones, and power tools. The batteries currently powering electric cars are lasting 10 to 20 years, which is longer than expected, but the industry remains confident that come 2030, there will be more than enough batteries to go around.\n\n“We’re going to increase our capacity by over 600 per cent in the next three to four years from what we currently have today,” says Klanecky of Cirba Solutions. “That’s what keeps me up at night. … We’ve got to build more plants, faster.”\n\nHow fast they’re able to scale up will determine how large a role recycled battery materials will play in reducing the need for mining, Pivnick says.\n\nAnother factor: how governments will choose to regulate the market.\n\nThe European Union has reached the first stage of an agreement that would make it the battery maker’s responsibility to dispose of the battery at its end-of-life. Laws like this already exist in Canada for household batteries and e-waste.\n\nUsed Tesla cars at Shift Electric Vehicles, a used car dealership for EVs in Oakville, ON. Jory Lyons / Global News\nThe EU is also considering mandating a minimum amount of recycled materials in new batteries: 16 per cent for cobalt, six per cent for lithium, and six per cent for nickel. This would be good news for recyclers, but an added hurdle for car makers who want cars off the production lines as fast as possible.\n\nPaterson, from automaker GM, warns that too much regulation happening too fast could be bad for business and innovation. He cites a misstep the Quebec government made two years ago when developing regulations on what to do with end-of-life EV batteries.\n\n“There are a lot of sort of kneejerk desires to regulate this because there is a notion that if we don’t regulate this immediately, it will get out of control,” Paterson says. “It’s regulating a problem that doesn’t exist yet. We have some time to do it properly.”\n\nTime is the one thing many Canadian recyclers feel they are up against. It’s a race to see whose technological prowess and business model will win out as supply chains solidify and the EV battery tsunami makes landfall.',
//   'U.S. shoots down suspected Chinese spy balloon over Atlantic ocean\nThe United States on Saturday downed a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the Carolina coast after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America.\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nUpdated Feb. 04, 2023 09:20 PMView original\nThe U.S. military on Saturday shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the Carolina coast on orders from President Joe Biden after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America, the latest flashpoint in tensions between Washington and Beijing.\n\nBiden wanted the balloon downed on Wednesday but was advised that the best time for the operation would be when it was over water, U.S. officials said. Military officials determined that bringing it down over land from an altitude of 60,000 feet would pose an undue risk to people on the ground.\n\nThe presence of the balloon in the skies above the U.S. this week dealt a severe blow to already strained U.S.-Chinese relations that have been in a downward spiral for years. It prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to abruptly cancel a high-stakes Beijing trip aimed at easing tensions.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“They successfully took it down and I want to compliment our aviators who did it,” Biden said after getting off Air Force One en route to Camp David.\n\nClick to play video: \'Biden says U.S. military shot down suspected Chinese spy balloon\'\n\n1:12 Biden says U.S. military shot down suspected Chinese spy balloon\n\nThe giant white orb was spotted Saturday morning over the Carolinas as it approached the Atlantic coast. About 2:39 p.m. EST, an F-22 fighter jet fired a missile at the balloon, puncturing it while it was about 6 nautical miles off the coast near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, senior defense officials said.\n\nCanada’s Minister of Federal Defence Minister Anita Anand says the nation “unequivocally supports” the United States government’s decision to shoot down the ballon, noting it violated Canadian airspace.\n\nAnand issued a statement after the balloon was downed saying she and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were briefed on the operation by the national security and intelligence advisor and the chief of the defence staff beginning on Friday night and continuing Saturday.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nClick to play video: \'Global National: Feb. 3\'\n\n22:56 Global National: Feb. 3\n\nShe said Canada has been closely engaged with its American counterparts on the decision and went on to thank the U.S. for its close collaboration.\n\nOn Friday, Anand’s office declined to comment on whether the balloon flew over Canadian airspace, but her Saturday statement says it “violated U.S. and Canadian airspace and international law.”\n\n“Officials in the national security community have been working bi-nationally and Canada has been closely engaged with its U.S. counterparts on the decision and unequivocally supports the actions taken,” Anand said in the statement.\n\nAnand noted Saturday that NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, had been “tracking and analyzing the trajectory and actions” of the balloon.”\n\nClick to play video: \'Why is China using a spy balloon in the age of advanced technology?\'\n\n2:22 Why is China using a spy balloon in the age of advanced technology?\n\n“The cooperation between Canada and the United States through NORAD ensures the security and defense of North American air sovereignty, and we thank its members for having the watch,” she said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada said Friday that officials summoned Chinese Ambassador Cong Peiwu to expressed disapproval over the balloon’s appearance.\n\nThe spectacle had Americans looking to the skies all week, wondering whether the mysterious balloon had floated over them.\n\nOn Saturday, Ashlyn Preaux, 33, went out to get her mail in Forestbrook, South Carolina, and noticed her neighbors looking up – and there it was, the balloon in the cloudless blue sky. Then she saw fighter jets circling and the balloon get hit.\n\n“I did not anticipate waking up to be in a \'Top Gun\' movie today,” she said.\n\nThe debris landed in 47 feet of water, shallower than officials had expected, and it spread out over roughly seven miles and the recovery operation included several ships. The officials estimated the recovery efforts would be completed in a short time, not weeks. A salvage vessel was en route.\n\nU.S. defense and military officials said Saturday that the balloon entered the U.S. air defense zone north of the Aleutian Islands on Jan. 28 and moved largely over land across Alaska and then into Canadian airspace in the Northwest Territories on Monday. It crossed back into U.S. territory over northern Idaho on Tuesday, the day the White House said Biden was first briefed on it.\n\nThe balloon was spotted Thursday over Montana, home to Malmstrom Air Force Base, which has fields of nuclear missile silos.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Americans were able to collect intelligence on the balloon as it flew over the U.S., giving them a number of days to analyze it and learn how it moved and what it was capable of surveilling, according to two senior defense officials said. The officials briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe officials said the U.S. military was constantly assessing the threat, and concluded that the technology on the balloon didn’t give the Chinese significant intelligence beyond what it could already obtain from satellites, though the U.S. took steps to mitigate what information it could gather as it moved along.\n\nRepublicans were critical of Biden’s response.\n\n“Allowing a spy balloon from the Communist Party of China to travel across the entire continental United States before contesting its presence is a disastrous projection of weakness by the White House,” said Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., tweeted: “Now that this embarrassing episode is over, we need answers from the Biden Administration on the decision-making process.

The Pentagon rejected that out of hand _ as well as China’s contention that it was not being used for surveillance and had only limited navigational ability.\n\nThe Chinese government on Saturday sought to play down the cancellation of Blinken’s trip. “In actuality, the U.S. and China have never announced any visit, the U.S. making any such announcement is their own business, and we respect that,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.\n\nThe Pentagon also acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America. “We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,” Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement.\n\nChina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a question about the second balloon.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Chinese spy balloons have crossed into U.S. airspace in recent years, one of the officials said. At least three times during the Trump administration and at least one other time during Biden’s time as president they’ve seen balloons cross, but not for this long, the official said.\n\nBlinken, who had been due to depart Washington for Beijing late Friday, said he had told senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in a phone call that sending the balloon over the U.S. was “an irresponsible act and that (China’s) decision to take this action on the eve of my visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nUncensored reactions on the Chinese internet mirrored the official government stance that the U.S. was hyping the situation. Some used it as a chance to poke fun at U.S. defenses, saying it couldn’t even defend against a balloon, and nationalist influencers leaped to use the news to mock the U.S.\n\nChina has denied any claims of spying and said it is a civilian-use balloon intended for meteorology research. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized that the balloon’s journey was out of its control and urged the U.S. not to “smear” it because of the balloon.\n\nIn preparation for the operation Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily closed airspace over the Carolina coast, including the airports in Myrtle Beach and Charleston, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. The FAA rerouted air traffic from the area and warned of delays as a result of the flight restrictions.

//   'Looking for a used car? Everything to know about Canada’s cooling market\n“Prices are going down,” one expert told Global News but Canadians can still expect delayed deliveries when entering the vehicle market.\n\nBy Irelyne Lavery\n\nUpdated Feb. 04, 2023 08:06 PMView original\nWhile the cost of new cars in Canada continue on an upward trend, the used vehicle market is finally starting to cool according to some experts.\n\nAs Canada begins to return to a “new normalcy” from the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for vehicles is balancing out and “prices are dipping,” specifically in the used car market, said Dimitry Anastakis, a professor at the University of Toronto’s history department and the Rotman School of Management.\n\n“We’ve had some crazy politics, some crazy economy, some crazy pandemic, some crazy climate change, and all of that has a real impact on cars,” Anastakis told Global News.\n\nWhy are prices of used cars falling?\nVehicle pricing over the past few years has been steep with the industry being hit by global semi conductor chip shortages, exacerbated by the pandemic and Russia‘s war on Ukraine. This left most automotive manufacturers scrambling for parts as they struggled to meet delivery demands for new vehicles. Consequently, prices for used vehicles soared as they were readily available.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nClick to play video: \'B.C. announces funding to help create more accessible taxis\'\n\n0:57 B.C. announces funding to help create more accessible taxis\n\nHowever, prices are now slowly on the decline.\n\n“The prices are going down (because) there’s been the lessening of demand,” Anastakis said.\n\n“In the used car market, a key reason prices are going down is because they’ve been so tremendously high since COVID. The auto industry slowed down considerably, which caused a scarcity…so prices went through the roof,” he said. “Now prices are coming down a little bit because some of that pressure has been alleviated.”\n\nChallenges faced by the new car market, including delivery delays, also drove people to choose used vehicles during the pandemic leading to high prices, according to Werner Antweiler, professor of economics at the University of British Columbia’s School of Business.\n\nBut now, as also noted by Anastakis, some pandemic obstructions are starting to wear off and demand for used cars is starting to stabilize, Antweiler told Global News. As a result, prices are going down.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“Some of the challenges we saw during the pandemic with deliveries led to people buying more used cars and that has been driving up demand for the lack of supply in the new car market,” he said.\n\n“Now, that is starting to balance out a little bit. It’s getting more back to normal, not quite there, but certainly it’s changing in that direction. And so, some of the pressure is coming off the used cars market.”\n\nWhat about new cars?\nIn the new vehicle market, prices are seemingly remaining steep, according to Antweiler.\n\n“We had a significant drop in car sales and as a result of the pandemic, we also had significant challenges to our supply chain. All that contributed to driving the prices up and now during the second half of the year, we have also seen interest rates go up,” he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAnd with interest rates on the rise, purchasing a new vehicle is becoming more expensive and slowing down demand because of the need to finance or lease, Antweiler explained.\n\n“Be mindful of interest rates,” he said. “We are still in a landscape where interest rates are going to be high for the remainder of the year. The higher cost from financing has slowed down demand.”\n\nAt the end of last month, the Bank of Canada delivered another hike into its key interest rate. The central bank raised the rate to 4.5 per cent, an increase of 25 basis point and the highest the Bank of Canada’s key rate has been since 2007.\n\nMoreover, the chip shortage hasn’t entirely passed either, according to Anastakis, so Canadians can still expect prices of new vehicles to remain high.\n\n“There’s been problems in supply which have really led to cause a spike in prices. One of the reasons chip-making is so important is because it fuels the auto industry and because of that chip demand — which was spiked during COVID, because people wanted to buy more digital devices because they’re all at home — there has been a slowdown,” he said.\n\n“You have your phone and it’s got chips in it, but your car has way more chips and there’s such a big demand.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nA look at the electric vehicles market\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles, prices of some makes are starting to balance out with fuel-run cars, according to Jospia Petrunic, president and CEO of the Canadian Urban Transit Research and Innovation Consortium.\n\nIn the U.S., Tesla Inc. recently cut prices by nearly 20 per cent on most of its models in an effort to bolster demand and raise market share.\n\nClick to play video: \'More people dip into their savings to make ends meet\'\n\n2:28 More people dip into their savings to make ends meet\n\nFollowing that decision, Ford also announced it would be slashing prices on its Mustang Mach-E electric SUV by nearly US$6,000.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“It’s not just that automakers woke up and decided to be environmentalists. That’s not what’s happening,” Petrunic told Global News.\n\nDemand for electric vehicles has largely remained low, but inflation has continued to rise, said Petrunic, so electric vehicle makers are trying to get as many consumers to enter the market before they get priced out.\n\n“What they’re trying to do is price slash to get you into the market to buy these electric cars before inflation and recessionary conditions make it totally unlikely and impossible,” she said. “It’s really automakers seeing the writing on the wall.”\n\nIn Canada, automakers may receive federal or provincial rebates if their electric vehicle is priced below a certain price. This is also causing costs to drop, according to Petrunic.\n\n\'Way more choice and way more options\'\nAccording to Anastakis, the world is at the tip of an “electric vehicle revolution.” With that in mind, he suggests consumers to wait, if they can, before entering the market.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“There’s going to be way more choice and way more options, and they’re going to improve every year,” he said, pointing at the future of electric vehicles. “If you can hold on to your car, hold on to it, because in the next ten years, [electric vehicles] are going to go from about five per cent of the market… to 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, to 20 per cent.”\n\n“It took about 25 years for the automobile revolution the first time around to really figure self out. And we’ve already got a lot of the infrastructure for automobiles because we’re not changing them. We’re just changing the way they’re powered,” he said.\n\nAccording to Antweiler, “the market is changing because of the transition from combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles.”\n\n“We expect to see a lot more models coming into the market all year or next as manufacturers are gearing up production of electric vehicles,” he said.\n\nBut, the first thing to remember when on the market for any type of vehicle is to shop around, Antweiler added.\n\nClick to play video: \'‘Our social cohesion is suffering’: Rising inflation, interest rates costing personal connections\'\n\n2:00 ‘Our social cohesion is suffering’: Rising inflation, interest rates costing personal connections\n\n“Compare different manufacturers on models because there are great differences. It’s always very wise to compare and get all the information you can,” he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhen buying a used car, it’s important to check the vehicle history report, have the car inspected, take it for a test drive and ensure the proper paperwork is completed upon purchasing, according to a 2021 report from Edmunds, an online car shopping guide.\n\nIf you are buying a car from an individual owner, make sure the seller properly transfers the title and registration to you. It’s important to close the deal correctly to avoid after-sale hassles,” the report said.\n\nAnd for those who are entering the market at this time, Petrunic is cautioning about delivery delays on new cars.\n\n“What I do think is probably here to stay for a relatively elongated period of time is the fact that what you buy may not arrive in the next few months of longer term, she said. Car ownership is unpredictable and expensive and who knows how long our economic constraints will last.”\n\n© 2023 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.',

//   'Can we stop an asteroid from hitting Earth?\nNASA has been working on a planetary defence system with the goal of keeping us safe from a big asteroid that could kill us all.\n\nBy Global News\n\nUpdated Feb. 03, 2023 06:58 PMView original\nNASA spent more than US$300 million on a spacecraft so they could smash it into pieces last year.\n\nIt sounds unbelievable, but it was done in the name of planetary defence.\n\nThe mission was part of a bigger effort to find a way to protect our planet from an asteroid that could end life on earth.\n\nIf that sounds extreme, then consider that meteors are bombarding our planet on a regular basis. According to NASA, it’s estimated that there are over 6,000 hits each year.\n\nThey start off as asteroids in the far reaches of our solar system but their trajectory sends them hurtling as meteors toward Earth, where if they survive entry into the atmosphere, they land as meteorites.\n\nMost are small and not very destructive but one day we could get hit by a big one and if it’s more than a kilometre wide, it will have catastrophic consequences.\n\nFor years, NASA, with help from 28 countries, has been working on a planetary defence system with the goal of keeping us safe from the one that could end it all.\n\nThe most recent step forward in planetary defence is a program called DART, which stands for Double Asteroid Redirection Test. It was the first mission of its kind. The concept was to move an asteroid by slamming a spacecraft into it.\n\n“We know that the dinosaurs went extinct by an asteroid or comet that hurt the Earth millions of years ago. But we want to be able to do something about that going forward in the future,” explains Nancy Chabot, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab near Baltimore, Md., and the coordination lead on the DART Investigation Team.\n\nNancy Chabot, coordination lead, DART at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. Sam Pinczuk/Global News\nThe target for DART was a double asteroid system, Chabot explains.\n\nThe two asteroids are about 11 million kilometres away from Earth. The larger asteroid, called Didymos is about 780 metres in diameter. It has a moon that goes around it called Dimorphos. It’s about 160 metres in diameter.\n\nOn Nov. 23, 2021, NASA launched the DART spacecraft from California aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, sending it on its long journey to Dimorphos.\n\nThe spacecraft was guided to the asteroids by a system called SMART Nav, which stands for Small-body Manoeuvring Autonomous Real-Time Navigation.\n\nChabot tells Global News’ The New Reality that it was a massive challenge for the spacecraft to hit something so far away. The team needed to develop something that would enable the spacecraft to steer itself, because it would be too far away, and travelling too fast, for the scientists to remotely guide it from Earth. Thanks to the SMART Nav system, the craft found its way to Dimorphos using technology, and not simply a hope and a prayer.\n\n“It had to be smart enough to tell the difference between these two asteroids within the last hour of the mission and then command itself autonomously to fire its thrusters to ensure it identified Dimorphos and hit Dimorphos head-on.”\n\nThe team chose an asteroid that was not a threat to earth.\n\nThe spacecraft, which has a body the size of a vending machine, guided itself on a collision course with the asteroid, which is about the size of a small football field.\n\nThe success of the mission was to be measured by whether the crash altered the path Dimorphos follows through space.\n\n“The goal of Dart was definitely all about asteroid deflection, not asteroid destruction. The idea is that this small nudge would add up to a bigger change in its position with time,” Chabot says.\n\nThis illustration made available by Johns Hopkins APL and NASA depicts NASA’s DART probe, foreground right, and Italian Space Agency’s (ASI) LICIACube, bottom right, at the Didymos system before impact with the asteroid. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\nArmed with a camera, the spacecraft provided NASA mission control real-time images as it moved into place for impact.\n\nAnd looking back, the scientists say it worked.\n\n“It successfully collided with an asteroid on Sept. 26, 2022, becoming humanity’s first demonstration of asteroid deflection,” Chabot says. “It’s terribly exciting that we’ve taken this first step in what’s called planetary defence.”\n\nIn fact, it turns out that the DART spacecraft did a better job than anticipated. Through observations from various telescopes around the world, the DART team was able to compare the orbit that Dimorphos followed before and after the impact. Scientists have discovered that Dimorphos’s orbit changed significantly after being struck.\n\nOf course, all of the important work being done by NASA wouldn’t have been possible without the knowledge we gain from the study of meteorites that land on Earth.\n\n“These different materials are going to react differently. If you use a kinetic impactor like DART, where you crash a spacecraft into it, you can see where that’s going to react differently depending on the composition of that material,” Chabot says.\n\nThe Golden Meteorite\nOne of the thousands of meteorites landing here on earth crashed through a roof in Golden, B.C., in October 2021.\n\nRuth Hamilton was asleep in her bed when she heard a loud crash. “I was so scared. I don’t think I’ve ever been as scared as anything else in my whole life. I jumped out of bed, turned on the light, and all I could see was a hole in my ceiling.”\n\nRuth Hamilton had a meteorite crash through the roof of her home in Golden, B.C. Darrell Patton/Global News\nOn her bed, just centimetres away from where she had been sleeping was a rock. It could have been fatal had it landed on her.\n\nAt first, she didn’t realize what she was dealing with. “I didn’t know how special it was because it was just the rock at that time. And then later on, we figured out that it was a meteorite.”\n\nThe meteorite has now been officially given the name: the Golden Meteorite.\n\nThere’s been a lot of interest in the meteorite from around the world. So far, Hamilton has provided a slice of the space rock to the team at Western University in London, Ont., for research.\n\nHamilton is still trying to figure out what she wants to do with the rest of it. “I haven’t quite decided what to do with it. There are lots of organizations out there that want it.”\n\nCanada’s Meteorite Collection\nChris Herd is one of the people who would love to examine the Golden meteorite.\n\nHe is a professor at the University of Alberta’s department of Earth and atmospheric sciences in Edmonton. He’s also the curator of Canada’s largest university-based meteorite collection.\n\nMore than 350 space rocks are housed in the meteorite museum at the U of A.\n\nGlobal News’ The New Reality got to get a close-up look at the collection, as well as the cameras Herd uses to track shooting stars.\n\nChris Herd is a professor at the University of Alberta’s department of Earth and atmospheric sciences in Edmonton. Marlon Parnell/Global News\nHerd says he can figure out where in the universe the meteorites come from based on their trajectory in the sky.\n\nThat’s important knowledge if we are going to figure out where the next potentially deadly asteroid might come from.\n\nHerd was able to capture images of the meteor while it was on its journey to Hamilton’s house.\n\nHe says Western Canada is a particularly good place for seeing meteors and finding meteorites.\n\n“We are in the Prairies, it’s relatively flat,” and that means good sightlines. There’s also the nature of the surroundings, he explains. “Because the land use in this part of the world is mostly farming and ranching, if something does fall, then the chances are better of actually getting out and finding it on the surface and being able to collect it.”\n\nHerd says he is working on ways to better preserve the meteorites he manages to acquire, including “things like keeping them cold and keeping them out of the Earth’s atmosphere.”\n\nRecently, he was sent part of a 15.2-tonne meteorite that fell in Somalia. And he says that what he discovered was quite surprising.\n\n“I discovered that there were some unusual-looking minerals inside, really — minerals that I couldn’t identify,” Herd says. “And so, when we delved into it more deeply, we realized that we had found three new minerals, minerals that have never been found before in this particular meteorite.”\n\nSuch knowledge about what makes up the meteorites and where they come from is important for future asteroid-moving missions.\n\nHerd says the more we know about potentially hazardous asteroids, both in terms of their physical properties and their composition, as well as where they come from, the more prepared we will be.\n\n“That really does buy us time and understanding for when there might be something even larger that is potentially hazardous.”\n\nAfter all, the DART mission is just the beginning of what NASA hopes can be accomplished in the future if we find our Earth in peril.\n\nAccording to Chabot, we still have plenty of time to figure it out. “You can actually have a warning time of 100 years. So you’re in the situation where you could do something like DART, where you could just give it a small nudge many years in advance and avoid a collision with the planet.”',
//   'They handled nuclear missiles. Now they\'re getting cancer\nA growing number of \'missileers\' — service members tasked with manning the nation\'s nuclear missile launch control centers — have shared that they were…\n\nBy Washington Post\n\nUpdated Feb. 04, 2023 03:27 PMView original\nMark Holmes spent his last 16 months battling Stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, undergoing chemotherapy, committing his life story to home video for his kids to one day watch and wondering how he had gone from picture-perfect health to bedbound. When the former Air Force major died at 37 in 2020, he had no idea others from his base had developed the same cancer.\n\nThree years later, a growing number of “missileers” — service members tasked with manning the nation’s nuclear missile launch control centers — have shared that they were diagnosed with cancer, and many have lymphoma. An unofficial crowdsourced document created by a Space Force officer and obtained by The Washington Post totaled 30 cancer cases tied to people who worked at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana over 50 years. Fourteen had lymphoma, and four, including Holmes, died, according to numbers tallied up last month. Most were men in their 30s and 40s, well below the median age of 67 for a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma diagnosis.\n\nAn Air Force lieutenant colonel who commanded Holmes argued in a Jan. 11 letter that Holmes’s cancer was caused by the thousands of hours he spent in the subterranean missile bunkers at Malmstrom. The letter, written to help Holmes’s wife prove his death was service-related so she could obtain survivor’s benefits, pointed to radon exposure and a slew of other chemicals in the 1960s-era silos as potential causes of the cancer. The letter warned of “a growing list” of missileers with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and other cancers, “exceeding normal rates for a population.”\n\n“He was so healthy,” Jenny Holmes said of her husband. “He was fit. He exercised, ate healthily. He never had any concerns at all.”\n\nThe letter noted that the cancer cluster was being investigated by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General after a complaint by another missileer who suffers from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The IG declined to confirm an ongoing probe, but Gen. Thomas A. Bussiere, who leads Air Force Global Strike Command, said the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine has started a formal investigation into the cases. A congressional inquiry has also begun, and there is mounting panic among the community of missileers. The discovery of the first nine cancer cases was first reported by the Associated Press.\n\nOther missileers, who worked at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming with near identical missile facilities, are now raising questions about their health. One former officer paid over $100 out-of-pocket for a blood test at a private clinic while he waits for Veterans Affairs to provide a full cancer screening. Meanwhile, the Holmes family is learning more about the carcinogens Mark was exposed to during more than 300 24-hour shifts deep underground where missileers await orders from the president in case the need arises to turn the launch key.\n\nHolmes’s family wants more answers about what caused his cancer, and they worry about other service members who are exposed.\n\n“It’s a waste of a good person,” Mark’s mother, Bev Holmes, said of her son. “For everybody who died or are in remission or still battling it, it’s a waste of their life. Their life is over or turned upside down, and it didn’t have to be.”\n\nA note written by Mark Holmes to his wife, Jenny Holmes, and a note from Will Holmes, 9, to his father when he was in hospice care, on a wall at the family’s home in Colorado Springs on Thursday.\nA note written by Mark Holmes to his wife, Jenny Holmes, and a note from Will Holmes, 9, to his father when he was in hospice care, on a wall at the family’s home in Colorado Springs on Thursday. Photo by Rachel Woolf /For The Washington Post\nA military briefing outlining missileers’ concerns was shared with the Air Force surgeon general and other medical professionals in the branch to gather more information, said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek.\n\n“We are heartbroken for all who have lost loved ones or are currently facing cancer of any kind and know that we have the responsibility to investigate any potential service-related risks to Airmen, Guardians or their dependents’ health,” she said.\n\nBussiere, who leads Air Force Global Strike Command, said in a statement that he had requested a formal investigation as soon as he was made aware of the presentation about cancer cases.\n\n“We are working together to create courses of action moving forward,” Bussiere said in the statement, first reported by the Associated Press. “We are committed to remaining transparent during this process and we pledge to maintain an open dialogue with members, their families and stakeholders throughout this process. As we move through the next phases of evaluation, we will continue to provide updates, including pertinent information, as identified.”\n\nMontana Sen. Jon Tester (D), chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said he has asked the Air Force for a full accounting of the cancer cases and other illnesses at Malmstrom, which house 150 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile silos, as well as other bases where missileers operate. He said any former or current missileers at the bases should be screened.\n\n“These Malmstrom missileers and their families deserve answers about the reported incidence of rare cancers they’re experiencing, and I will hold the Pentagon accountable to get them,” he said in a statement to The Post. “I’m in close touch with DOD and VA leadership to identify every potentially impacted servicemember and veteran, and will be pushing to ensure we get them the health care and benefits they’re entitled to as we work to understand the full picture of what happened at Malmstrom and other sites.”\n\nMinuteman III launch Facility E7 in Fergus County, Mont., on April 8, 2022.\nMinuteman III launch Facility E7 in Fergus County, Mont., on April 8, 2022. Photo by Demetrius Freeman /The Washington Post\nVeterans Affairs spokesman Gary Kunich told The Post that the department is working with the Defense Department to determine the size of the exposed population and evaluate them. Under the new Pact Act, which aims to help veterans exposed to toxic chemicals, lymphoma cancers are presumed service-connected for eligible veterans depending on the time and location they served, Kunich said. For veterans who are not eligible but believe they have service-related conditions, VA encourages them to file a claim for disability benefits, Kunich added.\n\nThe missileers’ cancer cases first came to light after a January military briefing by U.S. Space Force Lt. Col. Daniel Sebeck, a former missileer who described in a slide show obtained by The Post how missileers learned of the cases. A former Malmstrom missileer was paired with another he had previously worked with on the base through the Wounded Warrior mentorship program and learned of their shared diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The missileer then discovered the obituary for Holmes, who was also in their operations group. Within a weekend, the missileer made calls to discover nine officers at that base had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma between 1997 and 2007, according to the presentation.\n\nThe slide show briefed in January lists Sebeck as the leader of an effort to create a registry of cancer cases, which has garnered attention as word spread through Facebook groups and email chains between missileers. The growing information-gathering mission has formalized, and there is now an online form for impacted service members to share their information.\n\nWhile those involved expect the efforts will yield more cases than currently reported, the numbers are already startling, according to experts.\n\nAmitkumar Mehta, a director at the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s cancer center, said a dozen or more non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cases at a workplace should prompt an investigation.\n\n“I would be suspicious that there is something going on either related to chemicals, the lifestyle or the environment they are in together,” Mehta said. “Definitely there’s a red flag.”\n\nJenny Holmes holds her husband’s hat from while he was in service.\nJenny Holmes holds her husband’s hat from while he was in service. Photo by Rachel Woolf /For The Washington Post\nRadon and polychlorinated biphenyls, which Air Force employees said they were exposed to, are often linked to cancer diagnoses, according to experts. Those chemicals can pose a stronger impact if they’re exposed to workers in cramped spaces with weak ventilation, experts said.\n\n“Exposures and overexposures could have occurred, such that it would not at all be out of the question that these folks were overexposed to any number of chemicals that could be related to cancer,” said Marissa Baker, an assistant professor for the University of Washington’s environmental and occupational health sciences department.\n\nAlex Ruiz, another former missileer, has helped his friend Sebeck connect with others in their small profession that numbers in the hundreds and expand outreach efforts to find more service members outside the missileer community. Even he had not previously comprehended the problem until Sebeck discovered it, he said.\n\n“I’ve lost two friends that I didn’t even realize died in the last two years,” Ruiz told The Post.\n\nRuiz himself was diagnosed with melanoma in 2006 when he was 26. While the average age of those diagnosed is 65, according to the American Cancer Society, it’s also not uncommon in younger people. Still, Ruiz wonders whether his diagnosis is connected to his service as a missileer. He said the latest data showed 113 cancer cases identified at the three bases and others that ran nuclear missions. The Post has not seen the most recent version of the data sheet.\n\n“This might have been a circumstance of this particular profession for so long, but now it is impossible to hide it,” he said.\n\nTheir life is over or turned upside down, and it didn\'t have to be\n\nThe Association of Air Force Missileers has encouraged its members to seek testing and report health issues through the online form, executive director Jim Warner said. The group is waiting to see how the Air Force responds before determining how it will lobby the Pentagon.\n\n“The big concern for us is, is this a Malmstrom Air Force Base problem or is this an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] problem,” Warner said. “How far does this go? We have a lot of data that needs to be gathered and it’s too early to jump to any conclusions.”\n\nThe investigations underway are at their early stages, as officials in Washington try to get a better sense of the scope of the illnesses before probing causes, according to a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail ongoing conversations. Investigators expect to encounter challenges with information gathering as they go back decades to review environmental hazards.\n\n“It’s the same challenges across the board,” the staffer said. “How good is record keeping? How good is the data that was collected back then? What kind of exposures were people facing? How objective is the data? The problems we’re going to run into here are the same problems that we run into everywhere else. By and large, that data is not usually collected with some rare exceptions.”\n\nLike with overseas burn pits, which came under greater scrutiny after service members reported inexplicable breathing complaints, toxins could affect each person differently, meaning that authorities will review other types of illnesses that could also be associated with the bases, the staffer said.\n\nIn a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough, Tester requested information on “cancers, diseases or conditions along with any available data on incidence rate.”\n\nDane Meadows, a 35-year-old former security forces officer tasked with providing protection to missileers and the weapons at Malmstrom, said he has connected with others who have neurological autoimmune diseases like his. Meadows, who has neuromyelitis optica, now lives in a nursing home in New York, bedbound and unable to sit up, walk or speak for sustained periods. Through Facebook, he has connected with six other officers with similar neurological issues, including one with the same atypical disease.\n\n“It’s honestly hard to believe I went from a young Air Force officer, being hired to be a special agent, to practically homeless and fending for myself with a rapidly debilitating and potentially deadly disease,” Meadows said.\n\nMeadows learned of Sebeck’s presentation through his Facebook contacts, and contacted the lieutenant colonel to describe his medical history, Meadows said.\n\nJenny Holmes poses with her children, from left, Maddie Holmes, 11, Anna Holmes, 5, and Will Holmes, 9, at their home in Colorado Springs on Thursday.\nJenny Holmes poses with her children, from left, Maddie Holmes, 11, Anna Holmes, 5, and Will Holmes, 9, at their home in Colorado Springs on Thursday. Photo by Rachel Woolf /For The Washington Post\nMany of the service members who shared their stories with The Post described learning of a greater problem through word of mouth.\n\nCole Smith, a former missileer who worked at the F.E. Warren facility for five years, had stayed in touch with friends from the Air Force through his work as a screenwriter. Last week, three of those friends warned him of the cases at Malmstrom.\n\nBecause he is no longer in the Air Force, he doesn’t have health insurance through the government. While waiting to get an appointment at a VA clinic, plagued with aging technology and long wait times, he paid $100 for a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma test at Quest Diagnostics. He tested negative. But he is still waiting to get a screening for other kinds of cancer. He has an appointment to see a primary care physician at VA in about two months, at which point he can finally book a screening.\n\n“There’s a huge community of people out there over the last 60 years who have worked in the silos, the veterans,” Smith said. “And they should be taken care of.”\n\nAs he waits for his cancer screening, Smith said he fears learning of more diagnoses through his social network.\n\n“If there really is a problem at Malmstrom, is it just at Malmstrom or is it at the other missile bases but we just haven’t started asking there yet?” Smith said. “We’ve just scratched the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nIt is impossible to hide it\n\nJenny Holmes said the toll of these cancer cases reaches further than those who signed up to serve. She worries for her children – Maddie, 11, Will, 9, and Anna, 5 – who will grow up without their dad. She works extra hours as a nurse in Colorado Springs so that she can pay for Will’s therapy and other expenses associated with their loss because the Air Force doesn’t consider his death due to his line of work, she said.\n\nAfter her husband’s death, she had felt isolated from the Air Force community, left to mostly fend for herself, she said.\n\nBut since the effort to account for the cancer cases, Jenny has reconnected with her husband’s colleagues who have helped her file a claim for benefits. She has learned for the first time the hazards her husband was exposed to, and she thinks about what he had signed up for unwittingly, she said.\n\n“You just don’t know,” she said. “You’re signing a ton of paperwork and then all of a sudden they send you down there.”',
//   'Alberta lawyers decry mandatory Indigenous cultural training imposed by law society\nFifty-one petitioners say the training should be dropped by the Law Society of Alberta\n\nBy Tyler Dawson\n\nUpdated Feb. 04, 2023 10:36 AMView original\nFifty-one Alberta lawyers are arguing that the province’s attorneys should not have to complete mandatory courses on Indigenous cultures in order to practice law, ahead of a special meeting of the Law Society of Alberta to debate the merits of the “cultural competency” training.\n\nLeading the charge against the training is Calgary lawyer Roger Song, who garnered signatures for the petition that’s up for debate. In a letter to the law society, Song says that he grew up in China, and knows a thing or two about indoctrination.\n\n“This kind of mandatory education constitutes an insult to freedom of thought, belief, opinion, and expression,” he writes. “It amounts to a use of power to impose propaganda and politics.”\n\nStill, the signatories take pains to make it clear they do not believe that understanding Indigenous culture is unimportant. In an interview from his Calgary office, Song said that his belief is that lawyers would be better off if they could choose the sort of continuing education they underwent, based on their professional needs and other factors.\n\n“It will raise a lot of concern for people who may have a different worldview, who may have a different faith, who may have a different cultural perspective,” Song said. “Lawyers want to improve themselves by a lot of ways, but they don’t just want to be treated like a (third grade) student.”\n\nSong suggested the law society could establish seminars for lawyers to attend, or a forum to connect lawyers to Indigenous people to talk to them, instead of working from their home or office on an online course.\n\n“Nobody can claim that they, with a five hour video and reading some stuff, then suddenly you’re culturally competent,” Song said. “So we believe that this type of approach of mandatory program or mandatory education imposed by the law society is not in the public interest.”\n\nWhile the debate has spilled over into larger discussions of culture and politics, at least some of the signatories firmly believe what’s at issue is whether the law society actually has the power to implement continuing education. (Others, meanwhile, argue it’s well within the society’s powers.)\n\n“Rather, we oppose it because we do not believe the (law society’s board members) have or should have the power to mandate cultural, political, or ideological education of any kind on Alberta lawyers as a condition of practice,” says a letter to the law society.\n\nSince April 2021, the organization has mandated such training, citing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Call to Action No. 27, which calls on law societies to “ensure that lawyers receive appropriate cultural competency training, which includes the history and legacy of residential schools.”\n\nThe province’s lawyers had 18 months to finish the course.\n\nIn the time since, 9,769 Alberta lawyers were required to take the course. It’s called The Path, and pledges to teach lawyers about the history of Indigenous Peoples in Canada. The curriculum, which mirrors the sort of subjects social studies students tackle, includes Indigenous creation myths, the history of migration to the Americas, the history of the Indian Act and the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nNot in the public interest\n\nKrysia Przepiorka, an Indigenous defence lawyer, said she found the course to be fitting, and not “sugar-coated” when it came to tackling Canada’s history. She said when she heard of the objections to the course, she was disappointed, since she felt the course was a step in the right direction.\n\n“I found it accurate when I took the course and I just thought, you know, there was a lot of effort put into this course, and I really thought it was a great response to that call to action,” Przepiorka said.\n\nThe petition argues that mandatory training “unnecessarily diminishes and hinders professional autonomy in the area of (continuing professional development) to the detriment of the profession and the public.”\n\nYet, objections aside, just 26 of the lawyers who had to complete the training missed the October 2022 deadline; since then, all but eight lawyers have acceded to the rule.\n\nOn Thursday, the 51 signatories of Song’s petition were countered by a 400-lawyer-strong letter that favours retaining the present training regime. It also includes another 124 signatures from non-active lawyers, and law and articling students, and urges the law society to keep the training requirement.\n\n“The petition appears to be a direct attack on the Indigenous cultural competency requirement,” the letter notes.\n\nThe fact that the overwhelming majority of Alberta’s lawyers have done the course hasn’t stopped the controversy. And, while there’s the dimension of whether the law society even can — or should — mandate such training, some argue such training constitutes progressive indoctrination of the legal profession.\n\nLeighton Grey, a lawyer in Cold Lake, Alta., argues in a letter included in a package sent to law society members about the motion that The Path is based upon “political ideology” and is “rife with inaccuracy and skewed by a post-modernist history of Indigenous peoples in Canada.”\n\nGrey, a member of the Carry The Kettle First Nation in Saskatchewan, argues that his grandmother attended a residential school, and came away with fond memories; “stories like hers are far from unique and may in fact be far more representative of the (Indian Residential Schools) experience than the victimhood narrative” in the final TRC report, Grey writes.\n\nFrom the inbox: 400 lawyers sign letter supporting Indigenous cultural competency requirement for Alberta lawyers.\n\nComes days after 50 lawyers signed a petition asking the Law Society to repeal the rule that brought in such education. pic.twitter.com/AFXaK4SKS9\n\n— Jonny Wakefield (@jonnywakefield) February 2, 2023\nIn a lengthy essay for the Dorchester Review, Glenn Blackett, a litigator with the libertarian Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms, argues that the education program is part of a “radical, activist and authoritarian movement known as ‘wokeness.\'”\n\n“Through a combination of post-modern ideology and a clumsy, distorted and lopsided history, the main lesson intended for Alberta lawyers seems to be that Canadian history, as it relates to our indigenous people, is entirely one of racism and genocide — evils which somehow remain inherently lodged in Canadian law and legal structures,” Blackett writes.\n\nThe law society, for its part, has urged lawyers to side with the training, arguing that such a program is in the public interest.\n\nIf the members vote in favour of the motion to eliminate cultural competency training, the board — called benchers — will need to consider removing the training; it would then take a two-thirds vote among the law society’s 24 benchers to fully implement the change.\n\nBut, it seems likely that there will be substantial opposition; lawyers who support the training and oppose the motion have been calling out to their colleagues on social media to register to speak in favour at Monday’s meeting.\n\nPrzepiorka said she’s planning to attend Monday’s meeting, and intends to speak out in favour of the training program.\n\n“When I look at this as a First Nations person, I look at this as a commitment from a profession, that they are acknowledging our history in this country and they’re ensuring that their profession has accurate and competent cultural training,” Przepiorka said. “And then when I look at it as a lawyer, I think it’s a huge commitment for our law society in response to those calls to action. And I just thought, what a great way for our privileged profession to show our commitment to moving forward with Indigenous people.”\n\nNational Post, with additional reporting from the Edmonton Journal\n\n• Email: tdawson@postmedia.com | Twitter: tylerrdawson',
//   'Biden says he gave the order for Chinese balloon shootdown\nOn Saturday, in response to a reporter\'s question about the balloon, Biden said \'We\'re going to take care of it\'\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nUpdated Feb. 04, 2023 09:04 PMView original\nPresident Joe Biden said on Saturday that he ordered U.S. officials to shoot down the suspected Chinese spy balloon earlier this week and that national security leaders decided the best time for the operation was when the it got over water.\n\n“They successfully took it down and I want to complement our aviators who did it,” Biden said after getting off Air Force One en route to Camp David.\n\nFighter jets shot down the giant white balloon off the Carolina coast after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America and became the latest flashpoint in tensions between Washington and Beijing.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that Biden approved the shootdown on Wednesday, saying it should be done “as soon as the mission could be accomplished without undue risk to American lives under the balloon’s path.”\n\nAustin said that due to the size and altitude of the balloon, which was moving at about 60,000 feet in the air, the military had determined that taking it down over land would pose an undue risk to people on the ground.\n\nThe balloon was spotted Saturday morning over the Carolinas as it approached the coast. In preparation for the operation, the FAA Administration temporarily closed airspace over the Carolina coastline, including the airports in Charleston and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. The FAA rerouted air traffic from the area and warned of delays as a result of the flight restrictions.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The United States on Saturday downed a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the Carolina coast after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America and became the latest flashpoint in tensions between Washington and Beijing.\n\nAn operation was underway in U.S. territorial waters in the Atlantic Ocean to recover debris from the balloon, which had been flying at about 60,000 feet and was estimated to be about the size of three school buses. The balloon was downed by Air Force fighter aircraft, according to two officials who were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had told reporters earlier Saturday that “we’re going to take care of it,” when asked about the balloon. The Federal Aviation Administration and Coast Guard worked to clear the airspace and water below the balloon as it reached the ocean.\n\nTelevision footage showed a small explosion, followed by the balloon descending toward the water. U.S. military jets were seen flying in the vicinity and ships were deployed in the water to mount the recovery operation.\n\nOfficials were aiming to time the operation so they could recover as much of the debris as possible before it sinks into the ocean. The Pentagon had previously estimated that any debris field would be substantial.\n\nThe balloon was spotted Saturday morning over the Carolinas as it approached the coast. In preparation for the operation, the FAA Administration temporarily closed airspace over the Carolina coastline, including the airports in Charleston and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. The FAA rerouted air traffic from the area and warned of delays as a result of the flight restrictions.\n\nThe Coast Guard advised mariners to immediately leave the area because of U.S. military operations “that present a significant hazard.”\n\nBiden had been inclined to down the balloon over land when he was first briefed on it on Tuesday, but Pentagon officials advised against it, warning that the potential risk to people on the ground outweighed the assessment of potential Chinese intelligence gains.\n\nThe public disclosure of the balloon this week prompted the cancellation of a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Beijing scheduled for Sunday for talks aimed at reducing U.S.-China tensions. The Chinese government on Saturday sought to play down the cancellation.\n\n“In actuality, the U.S. and China have never announced any visit, the U.S. making any such announcement is their own business, and we respect that,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Saturday morning.\n\nChina has continued to claim that the balloon was merely a weather research “airship” that had been blown off course. The Pentagon rejected that out of hand — as well as China’s contention that it was not being used for surveillance and had only limited navigational ability.\n\nThe balloon was spotted over Montana, which is home to one of America’s three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base.\n\nThe Pentagon also acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America. “We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,” Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement.\n\nChina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a question about the second balloon.\n\nBlinken, who had been due to depart Washington for Beijing late Friday, said he had told senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in a phone call that sending the balloon over the U.S. was “an irresponsible act and that (China’s) decision to take this action on the eve of my visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.”\n\nUncensored reactions on the Chinese internet mirrored the official government stance that the U.S. was hyping the situation. Some used it as a chance to poke fun at U.S. defenses, saying it couldn’t even defend against a balloon, and nationalist influencers leapt to use the news to mock the U.S.\n\nChina has denied any claims of spying and said it is a civilian-use balloon intended for meteorology research. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized that the balloon’s journey was out of its control and urged the U.S. not to “smear” it based on the balloon.\n\n——\n\nAssociated Press writer Huizhong Wu in Taipei and researcher Henry Hou in Beijing contributed to this report.',
//   '\'Died suddenly\' posts twist tragedies to push vaccine lies\nMany posts online cite no evidence except that the person who died had been vaccinated at some point in the past\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nUpdated Feb. 04, 2023 05:41 PMView original\nResults from 6-year-old Anastasia Weaver’s autopsy may take weeks. But online anti-vaccine activists needed only hours after her funeral this week to baselessly blame the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nA prolific Twitter account posted Anastasia’s name and smiling dance portrait in a tweet with a syringe emoji. A Facebook user messaged her mother, Jessica Day-Weaver, to call her a “murderer” for having her child vaccinated.\n\nIn reality, the Ohio kindergartner had experienced lifelong health problems since her premature birth, including epilepsy, asthma and frequent hospitalizations with respiratory viruses. “The doctors haven’t given us any information other than it was due to all of her chronic conditions. … There was never a thought that it could be from the vaccine,” Day-Weaver said of her daughter’s death.\n\nBut those facts didn’t matter online, where Anastasia was swiftly added to a growing list of hundreds of children, teens, athletes and celebrities whose unexpected deaths and injuries have been incorrectly blamed on COVID-19 shots. Using the hashtag #diedsuddenly, online conspiracy theorists have flooded social media with news reports, obituaries and GoFundMe pages in recent months, leaving grieving families to wrestle with the lies.\n\nThere’s the 37-year-old Brazilian television host who collapsed live on air because of a congenital heart problem. The 18-year-old unvaccinated bull rider who died from a rare disease. The 32-year-old actress who died from bacterial infection complications.\n\nThe use of “died suddenly” — or a misspelled version of it — has surged more than 740% in tweets about vaccines over the past two months compared with the two previous months, the media intelligence firm Zignal Labs found in an analysis conducted for The Associated Press. The phrase’s explosion began with the late November debut of an online “documentary” by the same name, giving power to what experts say is a new and damaging shorthand.\n\n“It’s kind of in-group language, kind of a wink wink, nudge nudge,” said Renee DiResta, technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory. “They’re taking something that is a relatively routine way of describing something — people do, in fact, die unexpectedly — and then by assigning a hashtag to it, they aggregate all of these incidents in one place.”\n\nThe campaign causes harm beyond just the internet, epidemiologist Dr. Katelyn Jetelina said.\n\n“The real danger is that it ultimately leads to real world actions such as not vaccinating,” said Jetelina, who tracks and breaks down COVID data for her blog, “Your Local Epidemiologist.”\n\nDolores Cruz poses next to a photo of her son, Eric Cruz, on Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2023, at her home in San Gabriel, Calif.\nDolores Cruz poses next to a photo of her son, Eric Cruz, on Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2023, at her home in San Gabriel, Calif. Photo by Marcio Jose Sanchez /THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nRigorous study and real-world evidence from hundreds of millions of administered shots prove that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Deaths caused by vaccination are extremely rare and the risks associated with not getting vaccinated are far higher than the risks of vaccination. But that hasn’t stopped conspiracy theorists from lobbing a variety of untrue accusations at the vaccines.\n\nThe “Died Suddenly” film features a montage of headlines found on Google to falsely suggest they prove that sudden deaths have “never happened like this until now.” The film has amassed more than 20 million views on an alternative video sharing website, and its companion Twitter account posts about more deaths and injuries daily.\n\nAn AP review of more than 100 tweets from the account in December and January found that claims about the cases being vaccine related were largely unsubstantiated and, in some cases, contradicted by public information. Some of the people featured died of genetic disorders, drug overdoses, flu complications or suicide. One died in a surfing accident.\n\nThe filmmakers did not respond to specific questions from the AP, but instead issued a statement that referenced a “surge in sudden deaths” and a “PROVEN rate of excess deaths,” without providing data.\n\nThe number of overall deaths in the U.S. has been higher than what would be expected since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, in part because of the virus, overdoses and other causes. COVID-19 vaccines prevented nearly 2 million U.S. deaths in just their first year of use.\n\nSome deaths exploited in the film predate the pandemic. California writer Dolores Cruz published an essay in 2022 about grieving for her son, who died in a car crash in 2017. “Died Suddenly” used a screenshot of the headline in the film, portraying his death as vaccine related.\n\n“Without my permission, someone has taken his story to show one side, and I don’t appreciate that,” Cruz said in an interview. “His legacy and memory are being tarnished.”\n\nOthers featured in the film survived — but have been forced to watch clips of their medical emergencies misrepresented around the world. For Brazilian TV presenter Rafael Silva, who collapsed while reporting on air because of a congenital heart abnormality, online disinformation prompted a wave of harassment even before the “Died Suddenly” film used the footage.\n\n“I received messages saying that I should have died to serve as an example for other people who were still thinking about getting the vaccine,” Silva said.\n\nMany of the posts online cite no evidence except that the person who died had been vaccinated at some point in the past, using a common disinformation strategy known as post hoc fallacy, according to Jetelina.\n\n“People assume that one thing caused another merely because the first thing preceded the other,” she said.\n\nThis photo provided by Evergreen Creative Company of Dothan, Ala., is the senior photo of Tyler Erickson, a 17-year-old from Bonifay, Fla., who died unexpectedly in Sept. 2022.\nThis photo provided by Evergreen Creative Company of Dothan, Ala., is the senior photo of Tyler Erickson, a 17-year-old from Bonifay, Fla., who died unexpectedly in Sept. 2022. Photo by Christen Bane /THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nSome claims about those who’ve suffered heart issues also weaponize a kernel of truth — that COVID-19 vaccines can cause rare heart inflammation issues, myocarditis or pericarditis, especially in young men. Medical experts say these cases are typically mild and the benefits of immunization far outweigh the risks.\n\nThe narrative also has leveraged high-profile moments like the collapse of Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin as he suffered cardiac arrest during a game last month after a fierce blow to his chest. But sudden cardiac arrest has long been a prominent cause of death in the U.S. — and medical experts agree the vaccine didn’t cause Hamlin’s injury.\n\nFor some families, the misinformation represents a sideshow to their real focus: understanding why their loved ones died and preventing similar tragedies.\n\nClint Erickson’s son, Tyler, died in September just before his 18th birthday while golfing near their home in Florida. The family knows his heart stopped but still doesn’t know exactly why. Tyler wasn’t vaccinated, but his story appeared in the “Died Suddenly” film nonetheless.\n\n“It bothers me, him being used in that way,” Erickson said. But “the biggest personal issue I have is trying to find an answer or a closure to what caused this.”\n\nDay-Weaver said it was upsetting to see people exploiting her daughter’s death when they knew nothing about her. They didn’t know that she loved people so much she would hug strangers at Walmart, or that she had just learned how to snap.\n\nStill, Day-Weaver said, “I wouldn’t wish the loss of a child on anybody. Even them.”'
